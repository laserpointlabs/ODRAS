"""
Test Ontology Attributes & DAS Integration

This test validates the specific enhancements made to DAS2 ontology context:
1. Ontology attribute persistence (comments, definitions, metadata)
2. DAS2 comprehensive context integration
3. Rich ontology display in DAS responses
4. Both base and reference ontology support

This is a focused test of recent DAS2 enhancements.
