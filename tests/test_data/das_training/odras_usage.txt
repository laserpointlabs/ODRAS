ODRAS Usage Guide

ODRAS (Ontology-Driven Requirements Analysis System) is a comprehensive platform for managing requirements, ontologies, and knowledge in complex engineering projects.

Getting Started:

1. Project Setup
   - Create a new project or select existing project
   - Configure project settings and metadata
   - Add team members with appropriate roles
   - Set up project domains and namespaces

2. Ontology Management
   - Import existing ontologies or create new ones
   - Define classes, properties, and relationships
   - Use the Ontology Workbench for visual editing
   - Validate ontology consistency
   - Export ontologies in various formats

3. Requirements Management
   - Upload requirement documents
   - Extract requirements using DAS
   - Organize requirements by category
   - Create traceability links
   - Review and approve requirements
   - Generate requirements reports

4. Knowledge Management
   - Upload documents and files
   - Process documents for knowledge extraction
   - Search knowledge base using semantic search
   - Organize knowledge assets by project
   - Share knowledge across projects

5. DAS (Digital Assistant System)
   - Ask questions about your project
   - Get answers from project knowledge
   - Request requirement reviews
   - Generate documentation
   - Use natural language queries

Key Features:

- Multi-project support
- Role-based access control
- Version control for ontologies
- Requirements traceability matrix
- Semantic search capabilities
- Integration with external tools
- RESTful API for automation
- BPMN workflow support

Workbenches:

- Requirements Workbench: Manage and analyze requirements
- Ontology Workbench: Create and edit ontologies
- Knowledge Workbench: Organize project knowledge
- DAS Workbench: Interact with AI assistant
- CQMT Workbench: Test-driven ontology development

Tips for Effective Use:

- Use consistent naming conventions
- Document your work with comments
- Leverage DAS for common tasks
- Keep ontologies synchronized with requirements
- Regularly review and update knowledge assets
- Use version control for important changes
- Export data regularly for backup

Common Workflows:

1. New Project Setup:
   Create project → Import ontologies → Upload requirements → Process knowledge → Start development

2. Requirements Analysis:
   Upload document → Extract requirements → Review with DAS → Organize → Approve → Trace to design

3. Ontology Development:
   Define competency questions → Create classes → Add properties → Test with SPARQL → Refine → Publish
