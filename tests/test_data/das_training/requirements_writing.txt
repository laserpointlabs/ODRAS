Requirements Writing Best Practices

A requirement is a statement that describes what a system must do or a quality it must possess. Well-written requirements are essential for successful system development.

Characteristics of Good Requirements:

1. Clear and Unambiguous
   - Use precise language
   - Avoid vague terms like "user-friendly" or "fast"
   - Define technical terms

2. Verifiable
   - Requirements must be testable
   - Include measurable criteria
   - Example: "The system shall process 1000 transactions per second"

3. Complete
   - Include all necessary information
   - Specify inputs, outputs, and conditions
   - Cover normal and exceptional cases

4. Consistent
   - No contradictions between requirements
   - Use consistent terminology
   - Align with system architecture

5. Traceable
   - Each requirement should have a unique identifier
   - Link to source documents (stakeholder needs, regulations)
   - Track changes through version control

Types of Requirements:

- Functional Requirements: What the system must do
  Example: "The system shall authenticate users using username and password"

- Non-Functional Requirements: Quality attributes
  Example: "The system shall respond to user queries within 2 seconds"

- Performance Requirements: Speed, throughput, capacity
- Security Requirements: Access control, data protection
- Usability Requirements: User interface, ease of use
- Reliability Requirements: Availability, fault tolerance

Requirements Writing Template:

REQ-001: [Requirement ID]
Title: [Brief title]
Description: [Detailed description]
Priority: [High/Medium/Low]
Source: [Stakeholder or document]
Verification: [How to test this requirement]

Common Mistakes to Avoid:

- Mixing requirements with design solutions
- Including implementation details
- Writing requirements that are too broad or too narrow
- Using passive voice instead of active voice
- Missing acceptance criteria
