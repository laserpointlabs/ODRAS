DAS Comprehensive Context Awareness Test

This test validates ALL aspects of DAS context awareness including:
1. Project metadata and details awareness
2. Knowledge asset (file) awareness and content understanding
3. Ontology structure with rich attributes (NEW)
4. Conversation thread memory across multiple turns
5. Recent activity and event awareness
6. Edge cases and error handling
7. Realistic user workflow scenarios

This builds on existing DAS tests but adds:
- LLM-based evaluation for more nuanced scoring
- Multi-turn conversation memory testing
- Rich ontology attribute integration
- Edge case coverage
- Realistic user interaction patterns

Requirements:
- ODRAS running with all services
- das_service account authentication
- Test project with ontologies and uploaded files
