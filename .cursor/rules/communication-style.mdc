# Communication Style

## Be Direct
- NO lengthy summaries
- NO "What we accomplished" lists
- Get straight to implementation
- Show code/commands, not explanations

## When Things Go Wrong
- Identify the actual problem quickly
- Fix it immediately
- Don't apologize excessively
- Don't explain what should have been done differently

## Focus
- Action over explanation
- Results over process
- Implementation over theory
