# ODRAS Repository Standards

## File Organization
- Test files go in `tests/` NOT `scripts/`
- Scripts in `scripts/` are utilities, not pytest tests
- Root directory must stay clean (â‰¤15 files)
- All .md files except README.md go in `docs/`

## Database Management
- ALL migrations must be added to [odras.sh](mdc:odras.sh) init-db function
- Required Qdrant collections: knowledge_chunks, knowledge_large, odras_requirements, das_instructions, project_threads
- Always test with: `./odras.sh clean -y && ./odras.sh init-db`

## Git Practices
- After squash-merge: DELETE the feature branch locally and remotely
- Keep clean branch structure (main + current work only)

## Never Do
- Create .md files in root (except README.md)
- Add scripts to root directory
- Create multiple documents for same topic
- Remove scripts without checking BPMN workflow references
