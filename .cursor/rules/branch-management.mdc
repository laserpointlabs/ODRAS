# Branch Management (CRITICAL)

## After Squash-Merge
1. **ALWAYS delete the feature branch both locally and remotely**
2. **Clean branch structure**: Keep only active branches (main + current work)
3. **Branch cleanup commands**:
   ```bash
   git branch -D feature/branch-name              # Delete local branch
   git push origin --delete feature/branch-name   # Delete remote branch
   ```
4. **Never accumulate** old feature branches - clean as you go

## GitHub Integration
- Use GitHub CLI ('gh') instead of git commands when interacting with the repository
- Check GitHub build status and don't mark tasks as complete until build passes
- Only delete/clean up old branches after merging and main branch shows green for all tests

## Before Committing
- Don't commit code until it has been reviewed and tested
- Check the GitHub build status after committing and pushing code
- Verify all tests pass before claiming success
