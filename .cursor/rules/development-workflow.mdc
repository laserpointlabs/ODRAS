# Development Workflow

## Before Creating New Files
1. **Check existing files** - can you update instead of create?
2. **Consider consolidation** - does this belong in an existing document/script?
3. **Verify location** - is this going in the right directory?
4. **Check limits** - are we approaching file count limits?

## Code Quality Standards
- Follow patterns in [odras.sh](mdc:odras.sh) for robust process management
- Use proper error handling and logging
- Implement graceful shutdowns and force killing when needed
- Check port availability before starting services
- Anticipate and proactively handle repetitive code fixes

## Testing Approach
- Proceed slowly, one step at a time when developing features
- Always verify changes by checking via the API when testing functionality
- Don't explain what you did until changes work correctly
- Test from user's standpoint, not just API calls

## User Interface Guidelines
- Prefer traditional toolbar or menu and less cluttered buttons
- No goofy emojis; if using an icon, it should fit the project's theme and be black and white like the main vertical toolbar
- Use keyboard shortcuts (such as F12) for panel toggles instead of UI buttons
