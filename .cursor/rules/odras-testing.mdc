# ODRAS Testing Requirements

## Critical Testing Context
- ODRAS tests are **INTEGRATION TESTS** that require the FULL STACK running
- Tests connect to the REAL API at http://localhost:8000
- Required services: PostgreSQL, Neo4j, Qdrant, Redis, Fuseki, ODRAS API
- Test credentials: Username: `das_service`, Password: `das_service_2024!`

## Test Execution
- All services must be running via `docker-compose up -d`
- ODRAS API must be running via `./odras.sh start`
- Tests will be SLOW (8+ seconds for some operations) - this is EXPECTED
- Use 30-second timeouts for HTTP clients

## CI/CD Requirements
- GitHub Actions must spin up the complete stack
- The [ci.yml](mdc:.github/workflows/ci.yml) includes service definitions
- Tests run against real databases, not mocks

## Do NOT
- Create unit tests with mocked dependencies unless explicitly requested
- Use ASGITransport or in-memory test clients
- Apologize for slow tests - they test the real system
