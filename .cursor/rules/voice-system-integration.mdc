# Voice System Integration

## Voice Conversation Behavior
- Keep voice conversation tools talking continuously until user says "stop"
- Use voice-mode MCP tools for service management
- Test from user's standpoint, not just API calls
- Use das_service credentials for all testing

## Voice Testing Requirements
- Always test from user's standpoint, not just API calls
- Use das_service account (Username: das_service, Password: das_service_2024!)
- Don't say we are complete until user explicitly confirms
- Test the actual UI and user experience, not just backend APIs

## Voice Service Management
- Use voice-mode MCP tools for service management
- Check voice service status when debugging
- Verify audio dependencies are properly installed
- Test voice functionality end-to-end
