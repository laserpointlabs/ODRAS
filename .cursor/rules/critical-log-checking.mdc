# CRITICAL: Always Check Logs

## MANDATORY Log Checking
- **ALWAYS check logs after making ANY change**
- **ALWAYS check logs after starting/stopping services**
- **ALWAYS check logs when debugging issues**
- **ALWAYS check logs before claiming success**
- **Log checking is MANDATORY, not optional**

## Log Checking Commands
- Use `./odras.sh logs` for ODRAS application logs
- Use `docker-compose logs` for service logs
- Check both application logs and service logs
- Logs reveal the truth about what's actually happening

## Why This Matters
- Changes may appear to work but fail silently
- Services may start but not function correctly
- Database connections may fail without obvious errors
- API endpoints may return errors not visible in UI
- Logs are the definitive source of truth for system status

## Before Claiming Success
1. Make the change
2. Check logs immediately
3. Verify no errors or warnings
4. Test functionality
5. Check logs again
6. Only then claim success

**Remember: Logs don't lie - they show exactly what's happening in the system.**
