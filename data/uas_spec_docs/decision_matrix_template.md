- **Definition**: Alternative significantly outperforms requirements
- **Impact**: Superior performance with potential for expanded mission capabilities
- **Decision**: Optimal performance level

## Calculation Methodology

### Step-by-Step Process
**CALCULATION METHOD**: Weighted Scoring with Normalization
**OUTPUT**: Comparative ranking of alternatives

**Step 1: Raw Score Assignment**
- Assign a raw score (1-5) for each criterion for each alternative
- Base scores on objective data and subjective evaluation
- Document scoring rationale for transparency

**Step 2: Weighted Score Calculation**
- Multiply each raw score by the criterion weight
- Formula: Weighted Score = Raw Score × Criterion Weight
- Ensures higher-priority criteria have greater influence

**Step 3: Total Score Summation**
- Sum the weighted scores for each alternative
- Formula: Total Score = Σ(Weighted Scores)
- Provides overall performance assessment

**Step 4: Normalization for Comparison**
- Normalize results on a 0-100 scale for easy comparison
- Formula: Normalized Score = (Total Score / Maximum Possible Score) × 100
- Enables direct comparison between alternatives

### Calculation Example
**Alternative A**: Raw scores [4,3,5,4,3] × Weights [8,9,7,8,9] = Weighted [32,27,35,32,27] = Total 153
**Alternative B**: Raw scores [3,4,4,3,4] × Weights [8,9,7,8,9] = Weighted [24,36,28,24,36] = Total 148
**Normalization**: A = (153/205) × 100 = 74.6%, B = (148/205) × 100 = 72.2%

**STEP 2**: Assign raw scores (1-5) for each criterion based on evaluation
**STEP 3**: Calculate weighted scores by multiplying raw scores by weights
**STEP 4**: Sum weighted scores and normalize to 0-100 scale

## Sensitivity Analysis Framework

### Analysis Purpose
**ANALYSIS TYPE**: Weight Sensitivity Testing
**OBJECTIVE**: Ensure recommendation robustness against requirement changes

### Sensitivity Analysis Process
**STEP 1: Critical Criteria Identification**
- Identify criteria with highest weights (≥8)
- Focus on Regulatory Compliance (Weight: 10), Endurance (Weight: 9), Deployment Speed (Weight: 9)
- These criteria have greatest impact on final ranking

**STEP 2: Weight Adjustment Testing**
- Adjust weights of critical criteria up/down by 20%
- Test scenarios: +20%, -20%, and baseline weights
- Recalculate normalized scores for each scenario

**STEP 3: Ranking Stability Evaluation**
- Compare alternative rankings across different weight scenarios
- Identify if changes in weights alter the ranking of alternatives
- Document any ranking changes or stability

**STEP 4: Alternative Sensitivity Assessment**
- Identify if any alternatives are particularly sensitive to specific criteria
- Determine which alternatives maintain consistent performance across scenarios
- Flag alternatives with high sensitivity to weight changes

### Sensitivity Analysis Example
**Baseline Weights**: Regulatory Compliance (10), Endurance (9), Deployment Speed (9)
**Test Scenario**: Regulatory Compliance (12), Endurance (7.2), Deployment Speed (7.2)
**Analysis**: Compare ranking changes and identify most stable alternatives

### Decision Robustness Criteria
**ROBUST RECOMMENDATION**: Alternative maintains top ranking across all weight scenarios
**SENSITIVE RECOMMENDATION**: Alternative ranking changes with weight adjustments
**DECISION GUIDANCE**: Prefer robust alternatives for final selection
