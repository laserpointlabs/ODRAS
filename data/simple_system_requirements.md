# Unmanned Aircraft System Requirements

## Document Information
- **Project**: Multi-Rotor Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Platform
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Date**: January 2025
- **Purpose**: Basic requirements for testing ODRAS extraction

## System Overview
This document defines requirements for a small unmanned aircraft system (UAS) designed for reconnaissance and surveillance operations.

## Functional Requirements

### Flight Control
The UAS SHALL provide autonomous flight capability using Global Positioning System (GPS) waypoint navigation.

The system MUST support manual override control via ground control station at all times during flight.

The UAS SHALL automatically return to home location when commanded or upon loss of communication signal.

### Mission Operations
The system SHALL allow operators to define flight missions with waypoints, altitude, speed, and sensor activation points.

The UAS MUST be capable of maintaining stable hover at altitudes between 10 and 400 feet Above Ground Level (AGL).

The system SHALL provide real-time telemetry data including position, altitude, heading, battery status, and airspeed.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
The UAS SHALL achieve a minimum flight endurance of 25 minutes with standard payload.

The system MUST maintain position hold accuracy within 2 meters horizontal under wind conditions up to 15 knots.

### Safety
All flight-critical systems SHALL implement redundant sensors and dual-redundant flight control processors.

The UAS MUST include automatic geofencing to prevent flight outside authorized operational areas.

## Constraints

- The system MUST comply with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Part 107 regulations for small unmanned aircraft
- Maximum takeoff weight SHALL NOT exceed 55 pounds
- Visual line-of-sight operations are REQUIRED unless waiver is obtained

## Acceptance Criteria

All requirements marked as SHALL or MUST are mandatory for system acceptance. The system will be considered complete when all mandatory requirements are implemented and verified through flight testing.
