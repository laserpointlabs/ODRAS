## Integration with Core Project

The Core.SE project inherits foundational concepts from the Core project:
- **Requirements Engineering Standards** - Methodology for writing and validating requirements

By building on the Core project foundation, Core.SE demonstrates how systems engineering knowledge and practices scale from abstract principles to concrete system implementations.

## Ontology Development Strategy

The Core.SE ontology will extend the Core ontology with:
- **BSEO (Basic Systems Engineering Ontology)** - System structure, composition, interfaces
- **BSEO-RNM (Requirements and Needs Model)** - Requirements relationships and traceability
- **Domain-Specific Classes** - UAS, sensors, communication systems, mission concepts
- **Individuals/Instances** - Specific UAS platforms, actual sensor models, concrete requirements

This ontology-driven approach enables:
- Formal system modeling and reasoning
- Automated consistency checking
- Requirements traceability
- Design alternative analysis
- Knowledge reuse across projects
