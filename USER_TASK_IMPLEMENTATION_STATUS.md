# User Task Implementation Status

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. BPMN Workflow Fixes
- **Fixed the workflow loop**: After rerun extraction, the flow now correctly loops back to the User Review task instead of going directly to LLM Processing
- **Fixed the edit flow**: After user edits, the flow loops back to User Review for re-approval  
- **Removed unnecessary merge gateway**: Simplified the workflow by removing the `Gateway_MergeEditRerun`
- **Gateway wiring**: Verified that `Gateway_UserChoice` is properly wired with incoming flow from User Review task

### 2. User Tasks Tab in UI
- **Added new tab**: Created a "User Tasks" tab with a notification badge showing pending task count
- **Badge implementation**: Red badge appears when tasks are pending, hidden when no tasks
- **Tab content area**: Displays pending tasks in card format with key information
- **Auto-refresh**: Tasks are checked on page load and every 30 seconds

### 3. Backend API Endpoints
- **GET /api/user-tasks**: Fetches all pending user tasks across all process instances
- **Existing endpoints**: The complete user task endpoint already exists at `/api/user-tasks/{process_instance_id}/complete`
- **Task filtering**: API filters for active tasks of type `Task_UserReview` in the ODRAS workflow

### 4. Testing
- **Created test script**: `test_user_tasks_tab.py` to verify all functionality
- **All tests passing**: ✅ Main page, ✅ User Tasks API, ✅ JavaScript functions, ✅ Camunda status
- **No UI breakage**: Verified that adding the new tab didn't break existing functionality

## 📋 Still Pending

### User Task Review Interface (Task #6)
The basic infrastructure is in place, but the full review interface still needs:

1. **Requirements Display**: 
   - Show extracted requirements in a structured format
   - Display confidence scores and categories
   - Show source information

2. **Review Actions**:
   - **Approve**: Button to approve and continue to LLM processing
   - **Edit**: Interface to modify requirements (future enhancement)
   - **Reject/Rerun**: Option to re-extract with different parameters

3. **Integration**: 
   - Connect the `reviewTask()` function to display requirements
   - Handle task completion with user decision
   - Update process variables in Camunda

    ├─[Edit]──────────┘
    └─[Rerun]─────────┘
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Implement the full requirements review interface at `/user-review?taskId={taskId}`
2. Add ability to view and edit individual requirements
3. Implement the approval/rejection flow with proper Camunda task completion
4. Add requirement editing capabilities (later enhancement)
5. Add more detailed task information and process context

## 💡 Notes

- The tab infrastructure is solid and won't break when adding more functionality
- The BPMN workflow now correctly loops back for re-review after edits or reruns
- The API is ready to support the full review interface
- Testing infrastructure is in place to ensure stability
