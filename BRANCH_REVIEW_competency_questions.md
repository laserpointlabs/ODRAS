## Key Differences vs `feature/individuals-tables-fixed`

### ‚úÖ **Architecture Difference** (Critical Understanding)

**IMPORTANT**: The implementation approach differs significantly:

- **`feature/competency_questions`**: Has a **standalone** `frontend/cqmt-workbench.html` file (1,776 lines) - separate workbench interface
- **`feature/individuals-tables-fixed`**: Has CQMT **integrated as a TAB** within the ontology workbench in `frontend/app.html`
  - CQMT tab button: `<button class="workbench-tab" id="cqmtTab">`
  - CQMT content section with three sub-tabs: Competency Questions, Microtheories, Coverage
  - Same functionality, but embedded in the main ontology workbench UI
  - Better UX: All ontology-related features in one place

**The fixed branch's approach is better** - integrated workflow rather than separate interface.

### ‚úÖ **NEW/ADDED Files** (In competency_questions branch only)

#### Frontend UI
- **`frontend/cqmt-workbench.html`** - **STANDALONE FILE** (1,776 lines)

## Statistics

```
132 files changed

**Note**: The large deletion count is because this branch doesn't have the documentation reorganization and new services that were added to the fixed branch.

## Critical Findings

### ‚úÖ **Architecture Clarification**

**The fixed branch DOES have CQMT functionality** - it's integrated as a tab within the ontology workbench (`app.html`), not as a separate file.

**This is the BETTER approach:**
- Integrated workflow: All ontology tools in one interface
- Better UX: Users don't switch between different workbenches
- Same functionality: Competency Questions, Microtheories, Coverage tabs all present
- More maintainable: Single codebase for ontology work

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Standalone vs Integrated Approach**

**`feature/competency_questions`** has a standalone `frontend/cqmt-workbench.html` (1,776 lines) - this was the original separate workbench approach.

**`feature/individuals-tables-fixed`** integrated CQMT directly into the ontology workbench as a tab - this is the current working implementation.

### ‚úÖ **UI Implementation Status**

The `frontend/app.html` in the fixed branch already has:
- CQMT tab integrated into ontology workbench
- CQ Editor functionality
- Event monitoring UI
- Three sub-tabs: Competency Questions, Microtheories, Coverage
- Error handling and response processing
- **Fully functional and tested** (as confirmed by user)

The `feature/competency_questions` branch's `app.html` changes may have been early implementations that were later refined and integrated into the fixed branch.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Service Layer Differences**

The fixed branch has NEW services that this branch doesn't:
- `cqmt_dependency_tracker.py` - Dependency tracking
- `ontology_change_detector.py` - Change detection
- `property_migration.py` - Property migration

But this branch has additional test scripts that might be useful.

## Recommendations

### ‚úÖ **Recommended: Delete Branch** (If CQMT is working in fixed branch)

Since the fixed branch has a **fully functional CQMT tab integrated into the ontology workbench** (confirmed working by user), the standalone workbench approach in `feature/competency_questions` is obsolete.

**However, before deleting, check if these are valuable:**

1. **`CQMT_API_CHEATSHEET.md`** - API documentation (may be useful reference)
2. **Test scripts** - May contain useful test cases or examples:
   - `scripts/cqmt_full_workflow_test.py`
   - `scripts/test_cqmt_complete.py`
   - `scripts/test_cqmt_crud_complete.py`
3. **Any unique API endpoints or features** not in the fixed branch

### Action Plan:
1. ‚úÖ **Verify CQMT functionality** in fixed branch (CONFIRMED - user says it works well)
2. **Extract any valuable documentation** (`CQMT_API_CHEATSHEET.md`) if needed
3. **Review test scripts** to see if they provide useful test patterns
4. **Delete branch** once valuable pieces are extracted (if any)

The standalone `cqmt-workbench.html` file (1,776 lines) is **NOT needed** - the integrated tab approach in the fixed branch is the current working solution.

---

## Questions to Resolve

1. ‚úÖ **Is the `cqmt-workbench.html` interface still needed?** 
   - **ANSWER: NO** - The fixed branch has CQMT integrated as a tab in the ontology workbench
   - The standalone approach (1,776 lines) is obsolete
   - The integrated tab approach is working and tested

2. ‚úÖ **Were the UI improvements integrated?**
   - **ANSWER: YES** - CQMT is fully integrated in `app.html` as a tab
   - Has Competency Questions, Microtheories, and Coverage sub-tabs
   - User confirms it's working well

3. **Are the test scripts still useful?**
   - Many CQMT test scripts exist only in this branch
   - Could be valuable for CI/testing or as reference examples
   - Should review before deleting

4. **Is `CQMT_API_CHEATSHEET.md` still useful?**
   - Quick API reference guide (93 lines)
   - May be helpful documentation to preserve

---

## Next Steps

**Action Required**: 
1. ‚úÖ **CQMT functionality confirmed working in fixed branch** (user verified)
2. **Review test scripts** - Check if they provide useful patterns for CI/testing
3. **Decide on `CQMT_API_CHEATSHEET.md`** - Keep as documentation or delete
4. **Delete branch** - Once any valuable pieces are extracted (likely just the cheat sheet and possibly test scripts)

**Recommendation**: The branch can be safely deleted after extracting:
- `CQMT_API_CHEATSHEET.md` (if useful documentation)
- Any valuable test scripts (for reference/testing patterns)
