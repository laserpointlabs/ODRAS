[] Ensure that the requirements.txt stays up to date.<br>
[] Add tabs to main screen to open more than one workbench at a time.<br>
[] Keep project questions as approved by the project and we can continue to test with these.<br>
[] Consider a task script registry to select known and tested scripts for the bpmn tool.<br>
[] Keep requirements.txt up to date as we install new packages.<br>
[] Manage Ontology URI per object<br>
[] Manage Ontology Attributes<br>
[] Manage Ontology base object names<br>
[] Add user task workbench<br>
