THis file contains data dumps of just one lines for want, needs, and nice to haves for the ODRAS MVP. Im just trying to keep a log of what I think we need so I dont lose it. 

- I want to add the ability for the admin to to create a new users (view, create, admin controls) and if checked add a default project for that user. 

- ✅ DONE: Create a more clean demo project (init-db now creates single Default Project with demo content)

- ✅ DONE: add an ontology to the default project that is created as a part of the init-db and this ontology should containt some data objects and be loaded in the ontology canvas for the user to see as there is local storeage and remote storage these need to be in sync to the ontology is visible when crating (init-db now creates default ontology with CADFile, Specification, TestCase and other data objects) 

- Add admin controls to user creation and project controls (user/project/type)

- data manager needs to goupd by imports, and local project ontologies
