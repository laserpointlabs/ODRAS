THis file contains data dumps of just one lines for want, needs, and nice to haves for the ODRAS MVP. Im just trying to keep a log of what I think we need so I dont lose it. 

- I want to add the ability for the admin to to create a new users (view, create, admin controls) and if checked add a default project for that user. 

- Create a more clean demo project.

- Add admin controls to user creation and project controls (user/project/type)
