# ODRAS MVP Week 2 - Executive Summary

## Overview
This week's enhancements focus on creating a more structured, governed system for ontology-driven requirements analysis. The changes emphasize project isolation, controlled resource sharing, and improved data integration capabilities.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. ðŸŽ¯ Single Ontology per Project
**Change**: Each project will have exactly one base ontology, creating focused sandboxes for development.
- **Benefit**: Clearer project boundaries and simplified ontology management
- **Implementation**: Database schema changes, UI updates to enforce single ontology
- **Timeline**: 2 days

### 2. ðŸ”§ Data Manager Workbench (New Component)
**Change**: New workbench for connecting ontology data properties to external data sources.
- **Benefit**: Enable live data integration while maintaining semantic consistency
- **Features**: Auto-detect data properties, create data pipes to databases/APIs/files
- **Timeline**: 3 days (MVP scope)

### 3. ðŸ”’ Enhanced Project Isolation
**Change**: All resources (ontologies, documents, knowledge) are project-specific by default.
- **Benefit**: Better security and controlled sharing of intellectual property
- **Admin Controls**: Resources become global only through explicit admin approval
- **Timeline**: 2 days

### 4. âœ… Project Approval Workflow
**Change**: Option to approve entire projects, making all resources globally available.
- **Benefit**: Streamlined sharing process with quality gates
- **Quality Checks**: Automated validation before approval
- **Timeline**: 2 days

### 5. ðŸ¤– LLM Playground Enhancement
**Change**: Move knowledge RAG interface from Knowledge Workbench to LLM Playground.
- **Benefit**: Unified experimentation environment for all AI/LLM features
- **Features**: Model comparison, agent creation, prompt testing
- **Timeline**: 1 day

## Implementation Priority

### Must Have (Week 2)
1. Single ontology per project enforcement
2. Basic Data Manager Workbench (database connections only)
3. Project-scoped resources with admin controls

### Should Have (Week 2-3)
4. Project approval workflow
5. LLM Playground RAG integration

### Nice to Have (Future)
6. Advanced data pipes (APIs, real-time)
7. Automated quality gates
8. LLM agent marketplace

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Data Integration Complexity**: Start with simple database sources
- **Migration Impact**: Provide backwards compatibility mode
- **Performance**: Implement caching and lazy loading

### Process Risks
- **User Training**: Comprehensive documentation and guides
- **Approval Bottlenecks**: Automated checks reduce manual review
- **Change Management**: Phased rollout with pilot projects

## Success Metrics

### Week 2 Targets
- [ ] Single ontology enforcement operational
- [ ] Data Manager MVP functional with 1+ data source
- [ ] Project isolation implemented
- [ ] 80% automated test coverage
- [ ] Documentation complete

### Quality Gates
- All existing tests pass
- No performance regression
- Security audit passed
- User acceptance testing complete

## Resource Requirements

### Development Team
- 2 Backend developers (API, database)
- 1 Frontend developer (UI changes)
- 1 DevOps engineer (deployment, security)

### Infrastructure
- No new infrastructure required
- Existing PostgreSQL, Fuseki, Neo4j sufficient
- MinIO for file storage remains unchanged

## Decision Points

### This Week
1. Confirm MVP scope for Data Manager Workbench
2. Choose between individual vs. project-level approval
3. Finalize database schema changes

### Next Week
4. API integration complexity for Data Manager
5. Real-time data streaming requirements
6. Cross-project data sharing policies

## Communication Plan

### Stakeholders
- **Development Team**: Daily standups, technical reviews
- **Project Managers**: Progress updates every 2 days
- **End Users**: Feature preview and training by end of week

### Documentation
- Technical specifications (completed)
- API documentation (in progress)
- User guides (to be created)
- Migration guides (to be created)

## Conclusion

The proposed enhancements create a more robust, scalable foundation for ODRAS while maintaining focus on usability. The phased approach allows for incremental value delivery while managing technical complexity and risk.

**Recommendation**: Proceed with implementation focusing on must-have features first, with regular checkpoints to assess progress and adjust scope as needed.
