The microkernel → PDO (process-definition orchestrator) → TDE (task-definition executors) stack is a solid shape to get away from hand-coded orchestrators/workers and move to **process-centric**, grow-as-We-go execution.<br>
<br>
Why it fits what I want<br>
<br>
* **Everything is a process.** BPMN is a natural way to express “a set of interrelated activities that transforms inputs into outputs,” so we can model both orchestration (PDO) and unit work (TDE) without bespoke code paths.<br>
* **Iterative by design.** A recursive, always-on PDO gives we the continuous loop to discover work, dispatch it, learn, and refine—mirroring the “iterate → assess → improve” rhythm from decision/analysis best practice.<br>
* **Decomposes cleanly.** PDO monitors/labels active work; TDEs implement the **Input → Execute → Output** contract. That separation lets we swap/extend executors without touching orchestration logic (no more coded workers).<br>
* **Decision-aware.** Keeping everything in processes lets we attach value measures, human gates, and learning loops where they belong (process steps) instead of burying them in code.<br>
<br>
How to make it real (minimal contracts + rails)<br>
<br>
1. **TDE contract (keep it boring):**<br>
<br>
   * `inputs`: JSON payload<br>
   * `artifacts_in`: list of URIs (optional)<br>
   * `execute`: container image or adapter (python, http, cli)<br>
   * `outputs`: JSON payload + emitted artifacts<br>
   * `status`: {queued|running|succeeded|failed|compensate\_required}<br>
   * `logs/metrics`: streamed to the kernel logger/OTel<br>
   * `idempotency_key`: for safe retries<br>
   * `timeout/cancel/compensate`: hooks the PDO can call<br>
     This is enough to wrap scripts, tools, or services as **process-native** tasks (no custom worker code).<br>
<br>
2. **Task Spec (what PDO routes on):**<br>
<br>
```json<br>
{<br>
  "task_type": "data.extract.csv",<br>
  "inputs": {...},<br>
  "priority": "normal",<br>
  "capabilities": ["net=internal", "cpu=1", "mem=512Mi"],<br>
  "policy": {"retries": 3, "timeout_s": 900, "human_gate": false}<br>
}<br>
```<br>
<br>
3. **Registries (declarative, not code):**<br>
<br>
* **Process registry**: versioned BPMN definitions (kernel, PDO, domain flows)<br>
* **TDE registry**: discoverable task types → executor adapters (image/ref + schema)<br>
* **Policy registry**: retry/timeout/compensation, guard-rails, data-class rules<br>
<br>
4. **PDO loop (simple, observable):**<br>
<br>
* scan engine for **ready tasks** → enrich with process & data tags → resolve TDE from registry → dispatch → watch → emit events (success/fail/compensate) → loop.<br>
  This keeps the orchestrator thin and auditable (no business logic inside).<br>
<br>
5. **Governance “rails” (so it grows safely):**<br>
<br>
* **Versioning**: semantic versions for BPMN & TDEs; blue/green deployment of process defs<br>
* **Change policy**: human gate or canary for “high-impact” defs; auto for low-risk<br>
* **Observability**: per-task tracing, value measures, and decision checkpoints surfaced on dashboards<br>
<br>
Where the LLM helper fits<br>
<br>
* **Authoring**: prompt → draft BPMN snippet/TDE wrapper → validate against schemas → simulate → commit a new minor version.<br>
* **Curation**: suggest refactors (merge/split tasks, add compensation) and generate value/measure stubs so domain experts keep decisions explicit.<br>
* **Guarded execution**: LLM proposes; humans approve when policy requires. The microkernel enforces policies—not the LLM.<br>
  This lets domain experts **grow their own system** with assistance, while staying inside safe contracts.<br>
<br>
What to watch out for (and how to handle)<br>
<br>
* **Long-running or stateful work** → use BPMN async continuations + “heartbeat” tasks; push state to durable stores; make TDEs idempotent with compensation steps.<br>
* **Error handling** → always pair tasks with compensation/timeout paths in BPMN (don’t bury in code); PDO only coordinates.<br>
* **Data boundaries** → classify inputs/outputs; attach policies (PII, export-controls) per task type; have the kernel enforce.<br>
* **Sprawl** → require a short “decision frame” + value measure for new flows (even a lightweight one) so we keep intent and trade-offs visible.<br>
<br>
A simple path to migrate off coded orchestrators/workers<br>
<br>
1. Wrap a few existing workers as TDEs behind the contract (no logic change).<br>
2. Lift the surrounding orchestration into BPMN (start with the happy path).<br>
3. Introduce compensation/timeouts; cut over dispatch to PDO.<br>
4. Add the LLM helper for small changes (new task types, minor flow edits).<br>
5. Expand TDE library (script runner, HTTP caller, SQL/neo4j, file mover, model runner).<br>
6. Retire old orchestrator code.<br>
<br>
Why this is better than “code all the things”<br>
<br>
* We’re aligning with a **process-centric** definition (inputs → activities → outputs) that is comprehensible, auditable, and improvable by non-programmers.<br>
* We inherit the **iterate-evaluate-improve** loop from decision management (measure, analyze, refine), which our recursive PDO operationalizes.<br>
* We keep **logic where it belongs** (process) and **work where it belongs** (executors), so the system can evolve without rewrites.<br>
