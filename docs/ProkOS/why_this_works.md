The microkernel → PDO (process-definition orchestrator) → TDE (task-definition executors) stack is a solid shape to get away from hand-coded orchestrators/workers and move to **process-centric**, grow-as-We-go execution.

Why it fits what I want

* **Everything is a process.** BPMN is a natural way to express “a set of interrelated activities that transforms inputs into outputs,” so we can model both orchestration (PDO) and unit work (TDE) without bespoke code paths.
* **Iterative by design.** A recursive, always-on PDO gives we the continuous loop to discover work, dispatch it, learn, and refine—mirroring the “iterate → assess → improve” rhythm from decision/analysis best practice.
* **Decomposes cleanly.** PDO monitors/labels active work; TDEs implement the **Input → Execute → Output** contract. That separation lets we swap/extend executors without touching orchestration logic (no more coded workers).
* **Decision-aware.** Keeping everything in processes lets we attach value measures, human gates, and learning loops where they belong (process steps) instead of burying them in code.

How to make it real (minimal contracts + rails)

1. **TDE contract (keep it boring):**

   * `inputs`: JSON payload
   * `artifacts_in`: list of URIs (optional)
   * `execute`: container image or adapter (python, http, cli)
   * `outputs`: JSON payload + emitted artifacts
   * `status`: {queued|running|succeeded|failed|compensate\_required}
   * `logs/metrics`: streamed to the kernel logger/OTel
   * `idempotency_key`: for safe retries
   * `timeout/cancel/compensate`: hooks the PDO can call
     This is enough to wrap scripts, tools, or services as **process-native** tasks (no custom worker code).

2. **Task Spec (what PDO routes on):**

```json
{
  "task_type": "data.extract.csv",
  "inputs": {...},
  "priority": "normal",
  "capabilities": ["net=internal", "cpu=1", "mem=512Mi"],
  "policy": {"retries": 3, "timeout_s": 900, "human_gate": false}
}
```

3. **Registries (declarative, not code):**

* **Process registry**: versioned BPMN definitions (kernel, PDO, domain flows)
* **TDE registry**: discoverable task types → executor adapters (image/ref + schema)
* **Policy registry**: retry/timeout/compensation, guard-rails, data-class rules

4. **PDO loop (simple, observable):**

* scan engine for **ready tasks** → enrich with process & data tags → resolve TDE from registry → dispatch → watch → emit events (success/fail/compensate) → loop.
  This keeps the orchestrator thin and auditable (no business logic inside).

5. **Governance “rails” (so it grows safely):**

* **Versioning**: semantic versions for BPMN & TDEs; blue/green deployment of process defs
* **Change policy**: human gate or canary for “high-impact” defs; auto for low-risk
* **Observability**: per-task tracing, value measures, and decision checkpoints surfaced on dashboards

Where the LLM helper fits

* **Authoring**: prompt → draft BPMN snippet/TDE wrapper → validate against schemas → simulate → commit a new minor version.
* **Curation**: suggest refactors (merge/split tasks, add compensation) and generate value/measure stubs so domain experts keep decisions explicit.
* **Guarded execution**: LLM proposes; humans approve when policy requires. The microkernel enforces policies—not the LLM.
  This lets domain experts **grow their own system** with assistance, while staying inside safe contracts.

What to watch out for (and how to handle)

* **Long-running or stateful work** → use BPMN async continuations + “heartbeat” tasks; push state to durable stores; make TDEs idempotent with compensation steps.
* **Error handling** → always pair tasks with compensation/timeout paths in BPMN (don’t bury in code); PDO only coordinates.
* **Data boundaries** → classify inputs/outputs; attach policies (PII, export-controls) per task type; have the kernel enforce.
* **Sprawl** → require a short “decision frame” + value measure for new flows (even a lightweight one) so we keep intent and trade-offs visible.

A simple path to migrate off coded orchestrators/workers

1. Wrap a few existing workers as TDEs behind the contract (no logic change).
2. Lift the surrounding orchestration into BPMN (start with the happy path).
3. Introduce compensation/timeouts; cut over dispatch to PDO.
4. Add the LLM helper for small changes (new task types, minor flow edits).
5. Expand TDE library (script runner, HTTP caller, SQL/neo4j, file mover, model runner).
6. Retire old orchestrator code.

Why this is better than “code all the things”

* We’re aligning with a **process-centric** definition (inputs → activities → outputs) that is comprehensible, auditable, and improvable by non-programmers.
* We inherit the **iterate-evaluate-improve** loop from decision management (measure, analyze, refine), which our recursive PDO operationalizes.
* We keep **logic where it belongs** (process) and **work where it belongs** (executors), so the system can evolve without rewrites.
