ODRAS Software Description
==========================

Executive Summary
-----------------
ODRAS (Ontology-Driven Requirements Analysis System) is a problem-agnostic knowledge operations platform that assembles project-specific environments from a common architectural core. The system unifies knowledge management, requirements analysis, and decision assistance into an extensible suite of pluggable workbenches. Each deployment emphasizes consistent UI theming, strict isolation of tenant project cells, and full observability across artifact, data, and workflow lifecycles.

Core Platform Principles
------------------------
- **Problem-agnostic foundation**: The platform treats every initiative as a collection of normalized knowledge assets and workflows, enabling reuse across the WIR (Warfighter Integrated Requirements) scenario as well as future domains.
- **Composable capabilities**: Pluggable workbenches and DAS (Decision Assistance System) actions yield a tailored operating picture without code rewrites.
- **Continuous alignment**: Parent-child project structures keep enterprise directives linked to delivery teams, preserving context while allowing autonomy.

User Interface Design & Theme
-----------------------------
ODRAS maintains a restrained, monochromatic interface anchored by a vertical command rail and keyboard-oriented workflows. Major UI characteristics include:
- **Minimalist theme** with palette-constrained iconography ensuring accessibility and legibility in high-intensity, low-light command environments.
- **Workbench-centric layout** where each workspace exposes a focused toolset, aggregated status cards, and contextual DAS prompts.
- **Keyboard-first ergonomics** to accelerate analysts’ movement between knowledge review, requirement authoring, and publishing tasks.
- **Responsive grid system** that flexes seamlessly from large mission displays to laptop-class devices.

Modular Workbench Architecture
------------------------------
Workbenches encapsulate functional domains (e.g., knowledge intake, requirements vetting, publishing orchestration). They are dynamically registered modules that share authentication, project context, and event bus connectivity while remaining isolated at the service boundary. High-level behaviors include:
- Runtime discovery of available workbenches via the registry service.
- Fine-grained capability exposure governed by project cell membership and role-based policies.
- DAS-driven augmentation where recommendations surface inline through action cards.

Parent-Child Project Structure
------------------------------
Projects follow a hierarchical model: parent initiatives define overarching mission objectives, while child projects execute focused campaign phases. Relationships propagate:
- **Governance controls** that cascade mandatory policies to children while allowing localized overrides.
- **Shared knowledge baselines** where curated artifacts flow downward and synthesized insights propagate upward.
- **Cross-project lineage** that makes dependency tracking explicit for auditability and post-operation analysis.

Project Cells & Performance Tracking
------------------------------------
Project cells represent the operational teams at the edge of delivery. Each cell operates with:
- Dedicated workbench instances bound to its charter and security posture.
- An observable “batting average” metric, reflecting requirement acceptance rates, schedule adherence, and action completion velocity.
- Embedded DAS feedback loops that elevate underperforming trends and surface remediation actions.

Knowledge Flow & Data Lifecycle
--------------------------------
Knowledge assets progress through an ingestion, enrichment, validation, and publication pipeline:
- **Ingestion**: Source documents enter via BPMN-governed pipelines ensuring metadata normalization.
- **Enrichment**: Semantic tagging, ontology alignment, and entity resolution occur within the knowledge workbench.
- **Validation**: Analysts confirm accuracy within project cells, leveraging DAS suggestions and cross-checks.
- **Publication**: Approved artifacts move into Minio-backed persistent storage, ready for downstream consumption and AI augmentation.

Artifact & Data Publishing
--------------------------
- **Artifact publishing** orchestrates version-controlled releases to enterprise repositories, with audit trails anchored to the event bus.
- **Data publishing** routes structured exports to analytics, simulation, or partner systems, honoring data classification and tenant isolation.
- **Workflow guardrails** enforce review, approval, and compliance sign-offs prior to release, maintaining readiness for regulated environments.

Requirements Publishing
-----------------------
The requirements workbench synthesizes validated knowledge into structured requirements packages. Key elements include:
- Structured authoring templates aligned with acquisition standards.
- Automated traceability linking requirements back to originating knowledge assets.
- Stage-gate publishing that pushes baseline sets to external requirement repositories while logging state transitions on the event bus.

Event Bus Utilization
---------------------
The event bus underpins orchestration and observability:
- **Inter-workbench coordination**: Publish/subscribe patterns align actions between knowledge curation, requirement drafting, and DAS insights.
- **Telemetry capture**: Every significant state change emits events for dashboards, audit, and machine learning pipelines.
- **Action triggers**: DAS actions and automated remediations subscribe to event streams, enabling proactive engagement as capabilities mature.

Workbench Isolation & Security
------------------------------
- Each workbench executes within containerized service boundaries, ensuring faults and escalations remain contained.
- Tenant data isolation enforces project cell-specific data stores and access policies, mediated by attribute-based access control (ABAC).
- Security posture inherits baseline controls from parents while allowing child projects to introduce stricter overlays for classified work.

Containerization & Deployment Model
-----------------------------------
- Core services, workbenches, and integration adapters are containerized for predictable deployment across environments.
- Project cells can be replicated horizontally by instantiating additional container sets bound to new tenants.
- Deployment orchestrators (Helm charts, docker-compose stacks, or platform-native equivalents) integrate with CI/CD pipelines for rapid fielding.

DAS Integration & Actions
-------------------------
The Decision Assistance System acts as a cross-cutting intelligence layer:
- **Current state**: Reactive prompts and action cards surface based on analyst activity, requirement state changes, and anomaly detection.
- **Future state**: DAS is designed to become proactive, initiating investigations, recommending knowledge acquisitions, and scheduling workbench tasks without explicit prompts.
- **Action catalog**: DAS actions span knowledge enrichment, requirement refinement, publication readiness checks, and inter-project coordination tasks.

Core Capabilities for WIR & Beyond
---------------------------------
- **Mission readiness dashboards** summarizing project cell batting averages, readiness states, and action queues.
- **Extensible data schemas** accommodating emerging sensor feeds, intelligence products, or partner data.
- **Adaptive policy enforcement** mapping evolving regulatory requirements into deployable rule sets.
- **Cross-domain integration** hooks enabling future workbenches to onboard with minimal friction.
