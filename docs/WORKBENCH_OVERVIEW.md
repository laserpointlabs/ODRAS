## Benefits of New Organization

1. **Clear Separation**: Each workbench and architecture component has its own focused documentation
2. **Status Tracking**: Current status documents provide clear visibility into implementation progress
3. **Priority Management**: Next priorities are clearly defined for each component
4. **Dependency Mapping**: Dependencies between components are clearly documented
5. **Testing Visibility**: Testing status is tracked for each component

## Workbench Count

- **Total Workbenches**: 9
- **Core Workbenches**: 5 (CQMT, Ontology, Requirements, DAS, Knowledge Management)
- **Specialized Workbenches**: 4 (Conceptualizer, Configurator, Tabularizer, Thread Manager)

## Usage

- Each workbench/architecture folder contains its specific documentation
- `CURRENT_STATUS.md` files provide up-to-date implementation status
- Dependencies between components are clearly mapped
- Testing status is tracked for each component

## Maintenance

- Update `CURRENT_STATUS.md` files as implementation progresses
- Add new workbenches/architecture components as needed
- Maintain dependency mapping as system evolves
- Keep testing status current
