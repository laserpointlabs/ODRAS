## ODRAS Use Cases (Management View)

Concise, management‑ready scenarios ODRAS can support in the MVP and near term.

1. Ontology management: author/edit domain vocabularies; validate; manage imports/versioning later.
2. First‑order requirements management: extract, review, approve, and trace requirements to model elements with citations.
3. Early system conceptualization and allocation (ontology‑constrained): propose components/functions and allocations with traceability.
4. SysML/SysML v2 export: generate concept definitions/model skeletons from the ontology for MBSE tools.
5. ReqIF export: exchange approved requirements with external RM tools.
6. LLM‑assisted SE expert: grounded Q&A, suggestions, and critiques that improve with project history.
7. Traceability and impact analysis: visualize links and assess ripple effects from requirement or design changes.
8. Interface definition and ICD generation: derive and publish interface views from relationships in the model.
9. Compliance mapping: link requirements/model elements to standards and produce coverage reports.
10. Trade studies and decision support: run graph‑based analyses on dependencies and alternatives.
11. Knowledge ingestion and glossary: build a controlled glossary from ingested knowledge; enforce consistent terminology.
12. Risk/assumptions/uncertainty tracking: attach confidences/assumptions; surface hotspots.
13. Test planning and V&V: derive verification methods; export test case stubs tied to requirements.
14. Program communications: generate model‑backed briefs/white papers and status summaries.
15. Integration and automation: BPMN‑driven tasks, webhooks, and connectors to enterprise toolchains.
16. Reliability and sustainment up front: treat RAM and sustainment as first‑class from day one.
   - Capture reliability, availability, and maintainability attributes (e.g., MTBF/MTTR) and logistics constraints as ontology‑typed properties.
   - Link failure modes, maintenance tasks, spares, and support concepts to components/interfaces; flag sustainment hotspots.
   - Generate reliability/sustainment requirements with citations for review; export approved items via ReqIF and share sustainment data with downstream tools.
