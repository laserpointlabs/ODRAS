```

---

### **2. `test_das_comprehensive_context_awareness.py`** ✅ **NEW**

**Purpose**: Comprehensive DAS context awareness across ALL context types

### **4. Related Tests**

**`test_das_edge_cases_comprehensive.py`**: RAG-focused edge case testing
**`test_das_rag_simple.py`**: Basic DAS RAG functionality
**`ui_issues_log.md`**: Documents known limitations and issues

---

## Enhanced Evaluation System

### **🤖 LLM-based Evaluation** (Breakthrough Enhancement)

**Old Approach** (Rigid):
```python
# Brittle keyword matching
assert "wingspan" in answer  # Fails if DAS says "wing span"
assert "High priority" in answer  # Fails if DAS says "high-priority"
```

**New Approach** (Intelligent):
```python
# LLM judges answer quality on multiple dimensions
evaluation = await evaluate_das_answer(question, answer, expected_context)
# Returns: confidence_score, completeness, accuracy, relevance, feedback
```

**Evaluation Criteria**:
1. **Completeness**: Does it fully address the question?
2. **Accuracy**: Is the information correct and specific?
3. **Relevance**: Does it stay focused on what was asked?
4. **Detail**: Does it provide sufficient detail and examples?
5. **Context Usage**: Does it use available project/ontology context effectively?

**Fallback System**: Concept-based evaluation with bonuses for:
- **Concept matches**: Key terms and related concepts
- **Detail bonus**: Longer answers indicate rich context usage
- **Specificity bonus**: Numbers, dates, names indicate concrete knowledge

| **Conversation Memory** | Previous questions, multi-turn tracking | `context_awareness.py` | ⚠️ Limited |
| **Recent Activity** | Events, project history, user actions | `integration.py` | ✅ Basic |
| **Edge Cases** | Error handling, nonsense, ambiguous input | `context_awareness.py` | ✅ Graceful |
| **Cross-Context** | Synthesis across all context types | `context_awareness.py` | ✅ Tested |

## Key Achievements

### **🎯 DAS Intelligence Enhancements**

**Before Enhancements**:
```
User: "What classes are in my ontology?"
DAS: "I found some classes: Vehicle, Aircraft"
```

**After Enhancements**:
```
User: "What classes are in my ontology? Show priorities and creators."
DAS: "In the Working Base Ontology:
  • Vehicle (A motorized transport device...) [Priority: High, Status: Approved, Creator: das_service]
  • Aircraft (Flying vehicle using lift...) [Priority: High, Status: Review, Creator: das_service]
  • Component (Discrete functional element...) [Priority: Medium, Status: Draft]"
```

### **🚀 Rich Context Integration**

DAS now has comprehensive awareness of:
- **Ontology metadata**: WHO created WHAT, WHEN, with what PRIORITY/STATUS
- **Structural relationships**: Class hierarchies, property domains/ranges
- **Practical information**: Definitions, examples, specifications
- **Project context**: Full project metadata, namespace, domain
- **Knowledge integration**: Uploaded files connected to ontology concepts

### **🧠 Conversation Intelligence**

**Multi-turn conversation memory**:
```
Turn 1: "What's the weight of the UAVPlatform?"
Turn 2: "What about its maximum speed?" ← DAS understands "its" = UAVPlatform
Turn 3: "What was my first question?" ← DAS recalls weight question
```

**Status**: Basic functionality working, some limitations documented

---

## Known Limitations & Future Work

### **📋 Issues from Testing**

1. **Conversation Memory Sequencing** ⚠️
   - **Issue**: "What was my last question?" sometimes inaccurate
   - **Cause**: RAG vs chronological event conflicts
   - **Solution**: Conversation-specific MCP server (planned)
   - **Documented**: `ui_issues_log.md`

2. **JSON API Save Path** ❌
   - **Issue**: `PUT /api/ontology/` claims success but doesn't save classes
   - **Workaround**: Use Turtle save path (`POST /api/ontology/save`)
   - **Solution**: Fix `_json_to_rdf` method in `ontology_manager.py`
   - **Documented**: `MULTI_ENDPOINT_ONTOLOGY_ISSUE.md`

3. **Knowledge Asset Processing Latency**
   - **Issue**: Files need processing time before DAS can access content
   - **Impact**: Tests must wait 15-20s after upload
   - **Acceptable**: Not a bug, just processing reality

### **🔮 Future Enhancements**

1. **Hybrid Search** (Next Priority)
   - Semantic + keyword search for technical terms
   - 30-50% improvement expected for specific questions
   - Documented in `DAS2_PROMPT_GENERATION_ARCHITECTURE.md`

2. **MCP Servers** for Dynamic Context
   - PostgreSQL queries for analytics
   - Fuseki SPARQL for complex ontology queries
   - Events intelligence for conversation memory

3. **Advanced Conversation Memory**
   - Dedicated conversation MCP server
   - Timeline-based question routing
   - Improved "previous question" tracking

## LLM Evaluation Innovation

### **🧠 Scoring Methodology**

**Concept-Based Evaluation**:
```python
# Extract meaningful concepts from expected context
concepts = ["Vehicle", "motorized", "transport", "High", "Priority", "das_service"]

# Score based on concept matches + bonuses
base_score = (matches / total_concepts) * 70  # Max 70% from concepts
length_bonus = min(25, len(answer) // 80)     # Up to 25% for detail
specificity_bonus = 0-15                       # For concrete info (dates, names, numbers)

final_score = base_score + length_bonus + specificity_bonus
```

**Multi-Dimensional Assessment**:
- **Completeness**: Addresses full question scope
- **Accuracy**: Information correctness
- **Relevance**: Stays on topic
- **Detail**: Sufficient depth
- **Context Usage**: Uses available project context effectively

**Realistic Thresholds**:
- **90-100%**: Excellent (rare, indicates perfect context)
- **70-89%**: Good (solid performance)
- **50-69%**: Adequate (functional but room for improvement)
- **30-49%**: Weak (basic functionality only)
- **0-29%**: Poor (needs attention)
