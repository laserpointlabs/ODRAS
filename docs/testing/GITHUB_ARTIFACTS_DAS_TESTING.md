# GitHub Artifacts for DAS Testing

**Purpose**: Track DAS performance and test results across commits
**Location**: GitHub Actions → Workflow runs → Artifacts
**Retention**: 30-90 days depending on artifact type

## Overview

Every commit triggers comprehensive DAS testing with detailed reporting. Results are automatically uploaded as GitHub artifacts, providing:

✅ **Historical tracking** of DAS performance
✅ **Easy access** to test reports without digging through CI logs
✅ **Trend analysis** data for performance optimization
✅ **Debug information** when tests fail
✅ **Comparison** across commits and features

## Using Artifacts for Analysis

### **🔍 Debugging Failed Tests**

**When CI fails**:
1. **Download**: `das-test-reports-{sha}.zip`
2. **Extract and review**: `das_test_report_*.md` for executive summary
3. **Check logs**: `odras_app.log` for backend errors
4. **JSON data**: `*_report.json` for detailed test metadata

**Common Failure Patterns**:
- **Service startup issues**: Check application logs
- **Authentication failures**: Look for 401/403 errors
- **Timeout issues**: Check performance data for slow suites
- **Context problems**: Review confidence scores for specific areas

### **📈 Performance Trend Analysis**

**Track DAS improvement over time**:
1. **Collect data**: Download performance artifacts from multiple commits
2. **Extract metrics**: Parse `das_performance_*.json` files
3. **Create charts**: Plot confidence scores and response times over time
4. **Identify trends**: Look for improvements or regressions

**Key Metrics to Track**:
```python
# Sample analysis script
import json
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load multiple performance files
performance_files = ["das_performance_20251006_143000.json", ...]
dates = []
ontology_scores = []
response_times = []

for file in performance_files:
    with open(file) as f:
        data = json.load(f)
        dates.append(data["timestamp"])
        ontology_scores.append(data["suite_performance"]["ontology_attributes"]["avg_confidence"])
        response_times.append(data["suite_performance"]["ontology_attributes"]["duration_seconds"])

# Plot trends
plt.plot(dates, ontology_scores, label="Ontology Intelligence")
plt.plot(dates, response_times, label="Response Time (s)")
```

### **🎯 Feature Impact Assessment**

**Before/after feature development**:
1. **Baseline**: Download artifacts from commit before feature
2. **Enhanced**: Download artifacts from commit after feature
3. **Compare**: Side-by-side analysis of confidence scores and performance
4. **Validate**: Ensure feature improves target areas without regression

**Sample Comparison**:
```
Feature: Hybrid Search Implementation

Before (commit abc123):
  Ontology Confidence: 85.4%
  Technical Question Confidence: 45.2%
  Response Time: 12.3s

After (commit def456):
  Ontology Confidence: 86.1% (+0.7%)
  Technical Question Confidence: 67.8% (+22.6%) ← Significant improvement
  Response Time: 14.1s (+1.8s) ← Acceptable trade-off
```

## Best Practices

### **🔍 Regular Review Process**

**Weekly** (for active development):
1. **Check latest artifacts** from main branch
2. **Review confidence trends** for any degradation
3. **Monitor performance** for slow-down indicators
4. **Validate enhancements** show expected improvements

**Monthly** (for maintenance):
1. **Aggregate statistics** across all commits
2. **Identify patterns** in failures or performance issues
3. **Update test thresholds** based on sustained improvements
4. **Archive old artifacts** if storage becomes an issue

### **🎯 Using for Feature Development**

**Before starting enhancement**:
1. **Download baseline artifacts** from current main branch
2. **Note current confidence levels** for target area
3. **Set improvement goals** based on enhancement scope

**During development**:
1. **Run tests locally** using `scripts/generate_das_test_report.py`
2. **Compare with baseline** to track progress
3. **Adjust implementation** based on confidence score changes

**Before merge**:
1. **Download latest artifacts** from feature branch
2. **Validate improvement goals** achieved
3. **Check for regressions** in other areas
4. **Document changes** in PR with before/after metrics

## Sample Usage Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: CI Failure Investigation**

```bash
# 1. CI fails on commit abc123
# 2. Go to GitHub → Actions → Failed run
# 3. Download: das-test-reports-abc123.zip
# 4. Review: das_test_report_20251006_143000.md

Key findings from report:
- Context awareness test failed (timeout)
- Average confidence dropped from 67% to 23%
- Recommendation: Check ontology fetching performance

# 5. Review logs: odras_app.log shows SPARQL timeout errors

# After (feature commit):
Technical Question Confidence: 68.1% ✅ Goal exceeded
Response Time: 15.7s ⚠️ Slight increase acceptable

# Validation: Feature successful, performance impact minimal
```

### **Scenario 3: Monthly DAS Health Review**

```bash
# Download artifacts from last 10 commits
# Extract confidence trends:

October Performance Summary:
- Ontology Intelligence: 85.4% avg (stable, excellent)
- Context Awareness: 56.8% avg (improving +5% from September)
- Response Times: 18.2s avg (stable)

# Recommendations:
- Continue ontology context enhancements ✅
- Focus on conversation memory improvements 📈
