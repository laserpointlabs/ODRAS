# Self-Organizing Hierarchical Knowledge Management Systems: A Genetic Tree Approach

## Abstract

This research explores a revolutionary approach to organizational knowledge management that models knowledge systems as self-organizing genetic trees. The concept proposes that projects within an organization naturally form hierarchical relationships where knowledge inheritance flows from parent to child projects, creating an evolving ecosystem of domain expertise.

**Core Innovation:** Projects self-organize into hierarchical namespaces (gov/mil/ind â†’ domain â†’ program â†’ project) with Approved For Use (AFU) knowledge automatically cascading down the tree while specialized knowledge bubbles up through controlled approval workflows. A 24/7 AI system (DAS) acts as an intelligent knowledge broker, identifying cross-domain connections and presenting knowledge "commensurate with user capabilities."

**Key Research Areas:**
- Self-organizing hierarchical systems with conservative and dissipative organization
- Genetic algorithm optimization of knowledge structures
- Adaptive knowledge presentation based on user capability modeling
- Cross-domain knowledge discovery and translation

## Key Components

**1. Self-Organizing Hierarchical Systems:** These systems dynamically adjust their structure based on the evolving needs and inputs of the organization, facilitating efficient knowledge categorization and retrieval.

**2. Adaptive Knowledge Management:** By modeling knowledge systems as genetic trees, organizations can create a living knowledge base that evolves, branches, and occasionally prunes itself, mirroring natural selection processes.

**3. Ontology-Constrained Projects:** Each project is defined by a specific namespace and domain, ensuring that the knowledge it encompasses is automatically classified and constrained by the organization's ontology, maintaining consistency and relevance.

## Conclusion

The self-organizing hierarchical knowledge management system represents a revolutionary approach that transforms static knowledge bases into dynamic, living intelligence systems. By modeling organizational knowledge as genetic trees with evolutionary capabilities, this system can adapt, grow, and optimize itself based on user needs and organizational changes.

The integration of Growing Hierarchical Self-Organizing Maps, genetic algorithms, and adaptive user modeling creates a comprehensive framework for managing complex organizational knowledge while ensuring that each user receives information "commensurate with their capabilities."

This research direction promises to advance the field of knowledge management from reactive systems to proactive, intelligent partners in organizational learning and decision-making.
