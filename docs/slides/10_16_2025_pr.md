# ODRAS Presentation - October 16, 2025

## Slide 1: How We Got Here - The Genesis of ODRAS

### The Problem: Traditional Approach Wasn't Working
**WIRR Program Context**: Investigating weapons integration optimizations for next-gen Navy/Marine air vehicle (V-22 successor)

**What I Observed**:
- Discussions with airframers → updating PowerPoint slides → repeat
- **Ineffectual for a program of this gravity**: designing a new air vehicle
- **No systematic requirements capture**: just talking about capabilities from CDD (Capability Development Document)
- **FLRAA baseline discussions**: but no structured analysis or traceability
- **Knowledge loss**: tribal knowledge evaporating between meetings

### The Breakthrough: June 2024
**"There has to be a better way..."**

**Background**:
- Working with LLMs for data analysis and knowledge extraction
- Studying ontology-based communication with AI systems
- SysMLv2 → semantic-based notation → led to ontology exploration
- Serendipitous discovery of Barry Smith's Systems Engineering Ontology work (Buffalo)

**ReqFlow Experiment**:
- Extracted **435 requirements** from FLRAA CDD
- Asked LLM: *"What might we need to do this?"*
- Used early **BSEO_v1 ontology** (started as a "JSON file I dreamed up")
- **Conceptualized ~2,500 classes** automatically
- *"I didn't know this was an ontology at the time... lucky I guess"*

### The Evolution: From ReqFlow to ODRAS
**What ReqFlow Proved**: LLMs + Ontologies + Requirements = System Conceptualization at Scale

**WIRR as the Test Bed**:
- **Decision**: Build a tool to utilize LLMs for data capture, analysis, knowledge, and conceptualization
- **Goal**: Replace PowerPoint engineering with structured, traceable, AI-powered analysis
- **Result**: ODRAS (Ontology-Driven Requirements Analysis System)

**The DADMS Lesson** (Deloitte Contribution):
- Deloitte provided SysML model for Decision Analysis Data Model (DADMS)
- **My reaction**: *"What do I do with this? Print it out and check it off as I go?"*
- **Insight**: Models must be **instantiable and executable**, not just diagrams
- **Solution**: Integrated **BPMN workflows** into ODRAS for executable process models

### The Vision: Engineering with Intelligence
**From PowerPoint to Platform**:
- Systematic requirements extraction and analysis
- Ontology-driven conceptualization with DAS (Digital Assistance System)
- Executable workflows, not static diagrams
- Knowledge capture and institutional memory
- Traceable decision-making from requirements to concepts

**ODRAS Today**: What started as a June 2024 experiment is now a comprehensive platform supporting WIRR and beyond.
