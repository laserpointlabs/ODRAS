# DAS - Digital Assistance System
**AI-Powered Project Intelligence for ODRAS**

---

## What is DAS?

**DAS (Digital Assistance System)** is an intelligent AI assistant integrated into ODRAS that provides context-aware support for requirements analysis, system conceptualization, and knowledge retrieval. Unlike generic AI assistants, DAS is deeply integrated with your project data, ontologies, and domain knowledge.

### Core Capabilities
- **Natural Language Interface**: Ask questions about requirements, ontologies, components, and system designs
- **Requirement Analysis**: Interpret and validate requirements, identify conflicts and gaps
- **Concept Generation**: Create system components, interfaces, and functions from requirements
- **Knowledge Retrieval**: RAG-powered access to project documents, tribal knowledge, and vendor data
- **Decision Support**: Provide rationale and recommendations based on project context

---

## Project-Aware Intelligence

DAS operates within **Project Cells** - isolated environments that maintain complete separation between projects while enabling cross-project learning.

### How Project Awareness Works

    style PROJECT fill:#e8f5e9,stroke:#2e7d32,stroke-width:2px,color:#1b5e20
```

### Project Context Assembly

When you ask DAS a question, it automatically:
1. **Identifies Your Active Project**: Knows which project you're working on
2. **Loads Project Ontology**: Understands project-specific terminology and relationships
3. **Accesses Project Knowledge**: Retrieves relevant documents, requirements, and concepts
4. **Applies Project Rules**: Uses project-specific constraints and preferences
5. **Maintains Thread Context**: Remembers your conversation history within the project

**Example Query**: "What components are needed to satisfy the Marine avionics requirements?"

DAS Response:
- Searches only the FLRAA Marine project
- Uses the aerospace ontology vocabulary
- References Marine Appendix requirements
- Suggests components based on BSEO concepts
- Links to relevant vendor capabilities

---

## Per-Project Training & Customization

DAS learns and adapts to each project's unique characteristics and domain.

### Training Mechanisms

**1. Domain Ontology Loading**
- Project-specific ontology (e.g., BSEO + Aerospace extensions)
- Custom terminology and definitions
- Domain-specific relationships and constraints

**2. Document Ingestion**
- Requirements documents (FLRAA, Marine Appendix)
- Technical specifications
- Vendor documentation
- Design decisions and rationale
- Meeting notes and tribal knowledge

**3. Conversation Learning**
- DAS conversations stored in `project_threads` collection
- Learns from user corrections and feedback
- Improves suggestions based on project history
- Captures decision rationale and context

**4. Custom Instructions**
- Project-specific DAS behavior rules
- Preferred analysis methodologies
- Domain-specific guidelines
- Output format preferences

### Training Data Isolation

Each project maintains separate:
- **Vector Embeddings**: Project-specific knowledge chunks in Qdrant
- **Conversation Threads**: Project thread history in PostgreSQL
- **Ontology Context**: Project RDF store in Fuseki
- **Component Library**: Project concepts in Neo4j

**Result**: DAS becomes a domain expert for each project without cross-contamination

---

## Domain Knowledge Architecture

DAS integrates domain knowledge at multiple levels to provide comprehensive understanding.

### Knowledge Layers

**Foundation Layer (BSEO)**
- Base systems engineering concepts
- Universal relationships (hasComponent, performsFunction, satisfiesRequirement)
- Standard engineering terminology

**Domain Layer**
- Aerospace: aircraft systems, avionics, propulsion, structures
- Defense: weapons systems, C4ISR, mission systems
- Automotive: ADAS, powertrain, vehicle architecture
- Energy: power systems, distribution, renewable integration

**Project Layer**
- Project-specific components and interfaces
- Requirements and constraints
- Vendor capabilities and solutions
- Design decisions and assumptions

### Multi-Collection RAG Strategy

DAS searches across specialized vector collections:

| Collection | Purpose | Embedding Size |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| **knowledge_chunks** | Fast retrieval of document chunks | 384-dim |
| **knowledge_large** | Deep semantic search with OpenAI | 1536-dim |
| **odras_requirements** | Requirements-specific search | 384-dim |
| **das_instructions** | DAS behavior and guidelines | 384-dim |
| **project_threads** | Conversation history and context | 384-dim |

### Namespace Management

DAS intelligently manages ontology namespaces to ensure clean, consistent IRIs (Internationalized Resource Identifiers) across projects and domains.

**Key Principles**:
- **Program & Project Specific**: IRIs use program and project segments (e.g., `http://usn/adt/SE/core`), not user-specific segments
- **Lowercase Atomic Prefixes**: All prefixes are lowercase, no spaces, no special characters, no numbers
- **Combinable Prefixes**: Single-level atomic prefixes (e.g., `industry`, `lockheed`) combined in namespaces (`industry/lockheed`)
- **Managed Prefix Registry**: Custom prefixes pushed to centralized registry with metadata
- **Equivalence Linking**: Use `owl:equivalentClass` to link imported ontology classes to base classes

**Example Namespace Structure**:
```
http://usn/adt/SE/core#Component           # Base BSEO class
http://usn/adt/FLRAA/marine#MarineComponent # Project-specific extension
http://industry/boeing/systems#Payload      # Vendor ontology
```

DAS ensures namespace consistency when generating concepts, linking requirements, and reasoning across ontologies.

## Cross-Domain & Cross-Project Search

DAS can identify similar patterns, solutions, and knowledge across projects while maintaining security boundaries.

### "Like" Node Discovery

### Example Cross-Project Query

**Query**: "Show me how other projects have addressed payload integration challenges"

**DAS Process**:
1. **Embed Query**: Convert to 384-dim and 1536-dim vectors
2. **Apply Filters**: Check user permissions for project access
3. **Search Collections**: Query knowledge_chunks, project_threads, odras_requirements
4. **Find Matches**: 
   - Project Alpha: Weapons payload integration document (85% similarity)
   - Project Bravo: Thread discussing payload mounting solutions (82% similarity)
   - Project Charlie: Requirement for 2000 lbs payload capacity (78% similarity)
5. **Rerank**: Use cross-encoder for final relevance scoring
6. **Present Results**: Show top 10 with project names, context, and links

**User Benefit**: Learn from institutional knowledge across all projects without manually searching each one

4. **Start Asking**: DAS is ready to assist with analysis and conceptualization
5. **Refine Over Time**: DAS improves as you use it and provide feedback

### Example First Session

```
You: "What requirements do we have for Marine operations?"

DAS: "I found 23 requirements in the Marine Appendix related to shipboard 
operations. The key categories are:
- Corrosion resistance (5 requirements)
- Folding mechanisms (3 requirements)  
- Salt water environment (4 requirements)
- Carrier operations (11 requirements)

Would you like me to list them or focus on a specific category?"

You: "Focus on carrier operations"

DAS: "The 11 carrier operations requirements cover:
1. Arrested landing capability (REQ-MAR-011)
2. Catapult launch compatibility (REQ-MAR-012)
3. Deck handling procedures (REQ-MAR-013)
...

These requirements will need components like reinforced landing gear, 
carrier-compatible avionics, and specialized training systems. Would you 
like me to generate preliminary system concepts?"
