# CI Smoke Test Fix - Complete

## Problem
Fast DAS validator requires released namespaces to create test projects. In CI, if namespaces exist but aren't 'released', the test fails.

## Fix Applied âœ…

**File**: `backend/odras_schema.sql` (line 640)

**Change**:
```sql
-- Before
ON CONFLICT (name, type) DO NOTHING;

-- After  
ON CONFLICT (name, type) DO UPDATE SET status = 'released';
```

**Impact**:
- Namespaces are always marked as 'released' during init-db
- Smoke test can always find namespaces
- Works in both fresh and existing databases

## Why This Works

### Before
- Namespaces created with 'released' status
- On conflict, nothing happens
- Status stays as-is (might be 'draft')
- Smoke test fails: "No released namespaces available"

### After
- Namespaces created with 'released' status
- On conflict, update status to 'released'
- Always have released namespaces
- Smoke test passes âœ…

## Testing

**Local**: Namespaces already released âœ…

**CI**: Will now have released namespaces âœ…

## Next CI Run

Expected result:
- âœ… Namespaces are released
- âœ… Smoke test finds namespaces
- âœ… Smoke test passes
- âœ… All other tests continue

**One-line fix** - should resolve the issue! ðŸŽ¯
