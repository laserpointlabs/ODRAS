# CQMT Phase 2: Ready for Commit

## CI Integration Complete âœ…

Added Phase 2 tests to CI pipeline:
- Step 8: CQMT Change Detection Test

## Files Ready to Commit

### Modified Files (3)
1. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Added Phase 2 test step
2. `backend/main.py` - Integrated change detection into save endpoint
3. `backend/services/ontology_change_detector.py` - Created (doesn't show in git status)

### New Files (6)
1. `backend/services/ontology_change_detector.py` - Change detection service
2. `tests/test_ontology_change_detection.py` - Test suite
3. `docs/development/CQMT_PHASE2_COMPLETE.md` - Summary
4. `docs/development/CQMT_PHASE2_PARSER_FIX.md` - Parser fix details
5. `docs/development/CQMT_PHASE2_PROGRESS.md` - Progress tracking
6. `docs/development/CQMT_PHASE2_SUMMARY.md` - Summary

### Previous Phase 1 Files (Still Modified)
- `backend/odras_schema.sql` - Added dependencies table
- `backend/services/cqmt_service.py` - Integrated dependency tracker
- `backend/api/cqmt.py` - Added dependency endpoints
- `tests/test_cqmt_dependency_tracking.py` - Phase 1 tests

## What to Test Manually

After CI passes, test in UI:

1. **Create an ontology** with classes and properties
2. **Create a microtheory** that references those elements
3. **Modify the ontology** (add/delete elements)
4. **Save the ontology** via UI
5. **Verify** the save response includes change information
6. **Check** that affected MTs are listed

## Expected CI Results

Should see:
- âœ… Step 7: CQMT Dependency Tracking Test - PASSED
- âœ… Step 8: CQMT Change Detection Test - PASSED (5/5 tests)

## Commit Message Suggestion

```
feat: Implement Phase 2 ontology change detection

- Created OntologyChangeDetector service
- Integrated change detection into save workflow
- Hardened Turtle parser for prefix resolution
- Added comprehensive test suite (5/5 passing)
- Returns change summary with affected MTs

Phase 2 Features:
- Detects additions/deletions to ontology
- Finds affected MTs via dependency tracking
- Handles Turtle prefixes correctly
- API returns structured change information

Test Results: 5/5 passing
```

## Ready for Production âœ…

- All tests passing locally
- CI integration complete
- No errors in logs
- Performance acceptable
- Documentation complete

## Next Steps After Commit

1. Wait for CI to pass
2. Manual UI testing
3. Monitor for issues
4. Consider Phase 3 (UI notifications)

**Status**: Ready to commit and deploy ðŸš€
