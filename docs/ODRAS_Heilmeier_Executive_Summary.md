## ODRAS – Heilmeier Executive Summary (Management)

A plain‑language version of the Heilmeier catechism for the Ontology‑Driven Requirements and Architecture System (ODRAS) MVP.

ODRAS helps programs move from scattered documents to a shared, living model of the system. The MVP gives teams one simple place to organize requirements and knowledge, receive AI‑assisted suggestions with citations, and keep a single source of truth that is easy to review, search, and report. This executive summary explains the problem, the expected impact, what we will deliver in roughly one quarter, and how we will prove it works.

### 1) What are we trying to do?

Create a simple workspace that turns program documents into a shared, living map of the system (people, functions, interfaces, requirements). This helps teams see the same picture, find gaps faster, and make better decisions.

### 2) How is it done today and what are the limits?

- Documents and data are spread across many tools; the “map” is rebuilt by hand over and over.
- Language is inconsistent, traceability is weak, and handoffs are slow.
- It can take weeks to move from documents to actionable models and diagrams.

### 3) What’s new and why will it succeed?

- One place to organize knowledge and requirements and keep them in sync with the model.
- AI assists by suggesting elements and links from your documents, with citations; humans approve.
- Built on proven open‑source components; quick to stand up, easy to extend.

### 4) Who cares and what difference will it make?

- Program managers, chief engineers, and systems engineers.
- Faster review cycles, clearer alignment across teams, and audit‑ready traceability from requirement to model to decisions.

### 5) What are the risks and how will we mitigate them?

- AI accuracy: human‑in‑the‑loop review and cited sources.
- Adoption: keep the UI simple; start with one team, short training, quick wins.
- Integration: limit the MVP scope to a narrow set of workflows; add connectors later.
- Scope creep: deliver in three clear milestones with fixed demos.

### 6) How much will it cost and how long will it take?

- Timeline: ~1 quarter (10–14 weeks) for MVP.
- Team: 2–3 developers plus a part‑time SME/PM.
- Budget: $180k–$320k depending on rates; infrastructure costs are modest.

### 7) Midterm and final “exams” (go/no‑go demos)

- Midterm A (≈Week 4): You can edit and save the shared map; reopening shows the exact same view.
- Midterm B (≈Week 8): Import a sample requirements doc; AI suggestions with citations; reviewer approves; items appear in the map.
- Final (≈Week 12): End‑to‑end pilot on a real project; decisions and traceability shown in a brief report.

### 8) How will we measure success?

- 50% faster from “document import” to “first usable model”.
- 90% of AI suggestions accepted after human review on test sets.
- Open/save common projects in under 3 seconds.
- At least two teams adopt the tool in the first month after the pilot.

### 9) What are the deliverables?

- A working web app, a quick‑start guide, a sample project, and a pilot report with metrics.

### 10) If it works, what’s next?

- Change tracking and versioning, integrations with more enterprise tools, and governance/publishing features.
