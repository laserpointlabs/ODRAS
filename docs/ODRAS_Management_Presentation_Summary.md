### How the Project Cascade Works

**🔴 Admin Layer (Top)**
- **Knowledge Governance:** Controls what gets published globally
- **Organizational Ontologies:** Maintains core SE ontology, domain standards, enterprise models
- **Global Knowledge Base:** Curates published requirements, approved artifacts, best practices

**🔵 Level 1 Projects (Strategic)**
- **Inherit:** Core organizational ontologies and global knowledge base
- **Focus:** System architecture, program management, standards development, technology strategy
- **Contribute:** High-level requirements, architectural decisions, strategic direction
- **Publish:** Admin-approved contributions to global knowledge base

**🟢 Level 2 Projects (Tactical)**
- **Inherit:** All Level 1 project knowledge + organizational assets
- **Focus:** Subsystem design, implementation planning, process improvement
- **Contribute:** Detailed designs, trade studies, implementation strategies
- **Publish:** Selected contributions (with admin approval) to global knowledge base

**🟣 Level 3 Projects (Operational)**
- **Inherit:** Knowledge from parent projects + organizational assets
- **Focus:** Detailed implementation, testing, verification, optimization
- **Contribute:** Implementation details, lessons learned, performance data
- **Publish:** Best practices and lessons learned bubble up through hierarchy

### Key Benefits of the Cascade Model

1. **Knowledge Reuse:** Prevents reinventing the wheel across projects
2. **Consistency:** Ensures alignment with organizational standards
3. **Quality Control:** Admin approval prevents knowledge pollution
4. **Scalability:** New projects benefit from all prior work
5. **Learning Organization:** Systematic capture and sharing of lessons learned
6. **Incremental Growth:** Each project adds value to organizational knowledge base

### Decision Support Integration

- Each level can access decision histories from parent projects
- Decision performance feedback flows both up and down the hierarchy
- Option spaces expand based on proven solutions from related projects

## Key Insights from Development Session

### ODRAS as a Decision Operating System

The core realization during our discussion was that ODRAS is fundamentally a **Decision Operating System** - designed to:

1. **Evaluate Decision Option Spaces** - Systematically explore all viable alternatives before implementation
2. **Monitor Decision Performance** - Track real-world outcomes of implemented decisions
3. **Create Learning Loops** - Feed performance data back into future decision models
4. **Build Decision Intelligence** - Accumulate organizational wisdom about what works

### Management Communication Strategy

The presentation takes a **business-value-first approach**:
- Avoids technical jargon (RDF, SPARQL, etc.)
- Focuses on outcomes and competitive advantage
- Emphasizes integration with existing enterprise tools
- Positions ODRAS as a strategic capability, not just a project tool

### Cascade Model Innovation

The Project Cascade represents a breakthrough in organizational knowledge management:
- **Pyramid Structure:** Knowledge flows both up and down the hierarchy
- **Controlled Growth:** Admin approval ensures quality while enabling innovation
- **Systematic Reuse:** Small projects inherit vast organizational knowledge
- **Multiplicative Effect:** Each project contribution enhances the entire organization

---

## Next Steps

1. **Presentation Preparation:** Use this content to create actual PowerPoint slides
2. **Technical Documentation:** Create architecture diagrams and technical specifications
3. **Implementation Planning:** Develop detailed project plans for the cascade model
4. **Stakeholder Alignment:** Share the decision operating system vision with key stakeholders
