## New Documentation - October 12, 2025

### Ontology Imports Persistence Issues - Lessons Learned
**Created:** `docs/development/ONTOLOGY_IMPORTS_PERSISTENCE_ISSUES.md`
**Purpose:** Document failed attempt to fix ontology imports persistence for future reference
**Branch:** `fix/ontology_imports` (16 commits, October 11, 2025)
**Outcome:** Branch abandoned without merge - architectural refactor needed instead
**Size:** 450+ lines
**Status:** Reference documentation - Do not merge branch code

**Problems Documented:**
- Import disappearance on browser refresh
- LocalStorage vs Fuseki synchronization issues
- Data corruption during save operations
- Imported node position persistence failures
- Three-way state management conflicts (Canvas ↔ LocalStorage ↔ Fuseki)

**Attempted Solutions (All Failed):**
1. Backend synchronization - Fuseki as source of truth
2. Import system overhaul - atomic imports only
3. LocalStorage restoration fixes
4. Imported node position persistence changes
5. Data corruption prevention measures

**Diagnostic Tools Created:**
- Debug functions: `debugImports()`, `checkDataIntegrity()`, `emergencyReload()`
- Extensive logging with emoji prefixes
- Import synchronization verification
- Position persistence testing

**Root Causes Identified:**
- No clear source of truth between three storage layers
- Missing import lifecycle state machine
- Race conditions between async operations
- 15,000+ line monolithic frontend file (architectural debt)

**Recommended Future Approach:**
- Full architectural refactor with proper state management library
- Single source of truth (Fuseki) with localStorage as cache only
- Break up monolithic app.html into testable modules
- Test-driven development for import lifecycle

**Key Lesson:** Incremental fixes on architectural problems don't work - need planned refactor
## New Documentation - October 11, 2025

### Ontology Inheritance System Implementation
**Created:** `docs/features/ONTOLOGY_INHERITANCE_SYSTEM.md`
**Purpose:** Comprehensive documentation of successful ontology inheritance system implementation
**Issue:** Need for class inheritance with "is_a" relationships where child classes inherit parent properties in individuals tables
**Solution:** Complete inheritance system with multiple parents, cross-project support, conflict resolution
**Size:** 350+ lines
**Status:** Active - Core inheritance system operational

**Key Features Implemented:**
- Multiple parent inheritance with conflict resolution
- Cross-project inheritance from reference ontologies
- Abstract class support with UI validation  
- Enhanced properties panel with parent selection dropdown
- Individuals tables show inherited properties with visual indicators (↑)
- Property range conflict resolution (xsd:float > string)
- URI mapping between display names and RDF storage

**Test Case Confirmed Working:**
- Object class (ID property) → PhysicalObject class (Mass, Length properties) → Aircraft class (vendor property)
- Aircraft individuals table correctly displays: Name, ID↑, Mass↑, Length↑, vendor, Actions
- All inherited properties properly marked with inheritance indicators

**Modified Files:**
- `backend/services/ontology_manager.py` - Core inheritance engine with recursive resolution
- `backend/api/ontology.py` - New inheritance API endpoints 
- `frontend/app.html` - Multi-select parent UI, RDF conversion fixes, inheritance table generation

**API Endpoints Added:**
- `GET /api/ontology/classes/{class_name}/all-properties` - Returns inherited properties
- `GET /api/ontology/available-parents` - Lists available parent classes
- `GET /api/ontology/classes/{class_name}/hierarchy` - Returns inheritance tree
- `PUT /api/ontology/classes/{class_name}` - Updates class with inheritance data

**Remaining Minor Issues Identified:**
- Property duplication in RDF (workaround: conflict resolution active)
- UI field duplication in properties panel (cosmetic)
- Abstract class checkbox persistence refinement needed
- Parent selection persistence timing improvements

### RAG System Stabilization Guide
**Created:** `docs/development/RAG_STABILIZATION_GUIDE.md`
**Purpose:** Comprehensive documentation of RAG system fixes and improvements
**Issue:** UAS names query only returned 2 platforms instead of 9, source attribution failures
**Solution:** Enhanced chunk retrieval, fixed deduplication logic, improved source attribution
**Size:** 400+ lines
**Status:** Active - Primary reference for RAG system troubleshooting

**Key Changes Documented:**
- Increased chunk limits from 25 to 50 in DAS2 core engine
- Lowered similarity threshold from 0.15 to 0.1 for better coverage
- Modified deduplication to allow 3 chunks per document instead of 1
- Fixed source attribution by adding asset_id and document_type to chunk payloads
- Enhanced external task worker context from 3 to 10-15 chunks
- Created comprehensive test script for RAG validation

**Results Achieved:**
- UAS names query now returns all 9 platforms (was 2)
- Source attribution shows correct document titles (was "Unknown Document")
- Chunk retrieval increased from 3 to 9 chunks per query
- Response quality significantly improved with comprehensive details

**Modified Files:**
- `backend/services/das2_core_engine.py` - Chunk limits and thresholds
- `backend/services/rag_service.py` - Source attribution and deduplication
- `backend/services/store.py` - Chunk payload fields
- `backend/services/external_task_worker.py` - Context chunks

**Solution:** TCP keepalive, connection validation, pool size reduction, background monitoring
**Size:** 518 lines
**Status:** Active - Primary reference for connection pool debugging

**Key Changes Documented:**
- Added TCP keepalive to PostgreSQL connections (keepalives=1, idle=30s, interval=10s, count=5)
- Implemented connection health checks in `_conn()` method
- Reduced connection pool from 5-50 to 2-20 connections
- Created background monitor task (`backend/services/db_monitor.py`)

1. **Consolidate similar topics** into comprehensive guides
2. **Archive completed work** rather than keeping implementation docs
3. **Use clear naming conventions** with categories
4. **Regular cleanup** every 3-6 months
5. **Historical tracking** in this document

### Document Categories
- **Architecture** - System design and technical specifications
- **Features** - User-facing feature documentation
- **Deployment** - Installation and configuration
- **Development** - Developer guides and processes
- **Archive** - Historical documents (if needed for reference)

### Naming Conventions
- Use UPPERCASE for consolidated guides: `DAS_COMPREHENSIVE_GUIDE.md`
- Use descriptive names: `ONTOLOGY_WORKBENCH_GUIDE.md`
- Include version/date for specifications: `API_SPEC_v2.md`
