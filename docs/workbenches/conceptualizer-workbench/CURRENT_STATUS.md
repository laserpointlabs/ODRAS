# Conceptualizer Workbench - Current Status

## Overview
The Conceptualizer Workbench provides AI-powered system conceptualization from requirements with DAS integration and manual configuration capabilities.

## Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Features
- [x] DAS integration for automated concept generation
- [x] Configuration API endpoints
- [x] Graph visualization for system architectures
- [x] Individual table integration
- [x] Mock DAS fallback system
- [x] Configuration storage and retrieval
- [x] Batch generation capabilities
- [x] Real-time conceptualization

### üöß In Progress
- [ ] Advanced UI for manual configuration
- [ ] Configuration validation tools
- [ ] Enhanced graph visualization
- [ ] Performance optimization

### üìã Pending Features
- [ ] Manual configuration wizard
- [ ] Configuration templates
- [ ] Advanced filtering and search
- [ ] Export capabilities (Cameo, etc.)
- [ ] Configuration comparison tools
- [ ] Real-time collaboration

## Technical Debt
- UI responsiveness improvements needed
