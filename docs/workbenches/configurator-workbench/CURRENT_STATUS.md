# Configurator Workbench - Current Status

## Overview
The Configurator Workbench provides manual configuration capabilities for creating nested ontology-based tables without DAS, complementing the Conceptualizer Workbench.

## Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Features
- [x] Integration with Conceptualizer Workbench
- [x] Manual individual creation capabilities
- [x] Ontology structure integration
- [x] Configuration storage system

### üöß In Progress
- [ ] Manual configuration wizard UI
- [ ] Step-by-step individual creation
- [ ] Configuration validation
- [ ] User interface development

### üìã Pending Features
- [ ] Wizard-based configuration creation
- [ ] Template system for common configurations
- [ ] Advanced validation rules
- [ ] Configuration comparison tools
- [ ] Import/export capabilities
- [ ] Real-time collaboration

## Technical Debt
- UI development needed
- User experience improvements
- Documentation updates
- Integration testing

## Next Priorities
1. Complete manual configuration wizard UI
2. Implement step-by-step individual creation
3. Add configuration validation
4. User experience improvements

## Dependencies
- Conceptualizer Workbench (parent workbench)
- Ontology Workbench (for ontology structure)
- Individual Tables (for data management)
- Database Architecture (for storage)

## Testing Status
- Unit tests: ‚ùå Pending
- Integration tests: ‚ùå Pending
- UI tests: ‚ùå Pending
- User acceptance tests: ‚ùå Pending

## Architecture Notes
- Integrated as part of Conceptualizer Workbench
- Uses same data structures as DAS-generated configurations
- Different source types: "manual" vs "das_generated"
- No conflicts with existing conceptualizer functionality
