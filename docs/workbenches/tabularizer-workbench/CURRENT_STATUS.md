# Tabularizer Workbench - Current Status

## Overview
The Tabularizer Workbench transforms ontological individuals into structured, analyzable tables, bridging the gap between semantic models and traditional engineering analysis.

## Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Features
- [x] Basic concept and architecture defined
- [x] Integration with ontology system
- [x] Table generation framework

### üöß In Progress
- [ ] Core tabularization engine
- [ ] Table visualization UI
- [ ] Data export capabilities
- [ ] Analysis tools

### üìã Pending Features
- [ ] Advanced table formatting
- [ ] Custom table templates
- [ ] Statistical analysis tools
- [ ] Table comparison features
- [ ] Export to various formats (Excel, CSV, etc.)
- [ ] Real-time table updates
- [ ] Collaborative editing

## Technical Debt
- Core implementation needed
- UI development required
- Documentation updates
- Testing framework needed

## Next Priorities
1. Complete core tabularization engine
2. Implement table visualization UI
3. Add data export capabilities
4. Create analysis tools

## Dependencies
- Ontology Workbench (for individual data)
