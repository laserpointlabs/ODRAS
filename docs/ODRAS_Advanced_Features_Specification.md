## Executive Summary

This document outlines advanced features for the Ontology-Driven Requirements Analysis System (ODRAS) that will significantly enhance its capabilities in systems engineering, modeling, simulation, and analysis. These features build upon the existing ontology workbench and cytoscape-based visualization architecture to provide comprehensive SysML v2 modeling, deterministic LLM tool integration, advanced requirements analysis, and knowledge capture capabilities.

The advanced features are designed to support complex aircraft and missile system synthesis, controls system design, and modeling & simulation workflows while maintaining the ontological foundation that makes ODRAS unique in the requirements analysis domain.

## 1. SysML v2-Lite Integration

### 1.1 Overview

The SysML v2-Lite integration will provide a comprehensive modeling environment that leverages the existing ontology cytoscape tool architecture while adding native SysML v2 capabilities. This feature will enable users to create system models using both visual canvas-based editing and native SysML v2 text syntax.

### 1.2 Architecture Integration

Building on the existing ontology workbench architecture:
