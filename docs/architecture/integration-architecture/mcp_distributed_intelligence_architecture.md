## Executive Summary

This paper proposes a revolutionary architecture for ODRAS using Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to transform the Digital Assistant System (DAS) from a "smart RAG system" into a "comprehensive aerospace engineering intelligence platform." The proposed architecture addresses current limitations in conversation memory and real-time data access while expanding capabilities to include mission simulation, numerical analysis, and advanced aerospace engineering workflows.

**Key Innovations:**
- **Distributed Intelligence**: Domain-expert MCP servers for specialized operations
- **Real-Time Data Integrity**: Direct connections to authoritative data sources
- **Mission Simulation Integration**: AFSIM and STK integration for aerospace scenarios
- **Numerical Analysis Platform**: Scilab and MATLAB integration for engineering calculations
- **Conversation Intelligence**: Chronological event-based memory management

---

## 1. Current State Analysis

### 1.1 Identified Issues

Through comprehensive UI testing with Playwright automation, we identified key architectural limitations:

#### **Issue #1: Conversation Memory Sequencing**
- **Problem**: DAS cannot accurately track "last question" in conversation threads
- **Root Cause**: Relies on RAG to find conversation context instead of chronological event data
- **Impact**: Poor user experience for follow-up questions and temporal references

#### **Issue #2: Stale Ontology Data**
- **Problem**: DAS shows cached class names vs. live ontology updates
- **Root Cause**: Context derived from RAG searches rather than live Fuseki queries
- **Impact**: Inconsistent information about current ontology state

#### **Issue #3: Limited Domain Expertise**
- **Problem**: DAS limited to knowledge document analysis
- **Root Cause**: No integration with specialized aerospace engineering tools
- **Impact**: Cannot perform mission analysis, numerical calculations, or simulation tasks

### 1.2 Current Strengths to Preserve

- ✅ **Excellent RAG Performance**: Knowledge retrieval with proper source attribution
- ✅ **Advanced Response Generation**: Complex table creation, multi-UAV analysis
- ✅ **Project Awareness**: Creator identification, file management, metadata access
- ✅ **UI Integration**: Seamless file upload workflow, embedded processing

```

### 2.2 Core Design Principles

#### **Domain Expertise Separation**
Each MCP server is responsible for its specific domain:
- **Real-time data access** to authoritative sources
- **Domain-specific query optimization**
- **Specialized response formatting**
- **Independent testing and deployment**

#### **Intelligent Query Routing**
DAS analyzes query intent and routes to appropriate servers:
- **Temporal queries** → Project Events MCP
- **Structural queries** → Ontology MCP
- **Simulation requests** → Mission Simulation MCP
- **Calculations** → Numerical Analysis MCP
- **Knowledge queries** → Knowledge Assets MCP + RAG

#### **Context Synthesis**
Multiple MCP servers can contribute to a single response:
- **Cross-domain intelligence** combining multiple data sources
- **Hierarchical context building** with relevance weighting
- **Conflict resolution** when servers provide contradictory information

    except MCPTimeoutError:
        # Fallback to RAG-only response
        logger.warning("MCP timeout, falling back to RAG")
        return await rag_service.query_knowledge_base(query)
    except MCPServerError as e:
        # Partial failure - continue with available servers
        logger.error(f"MCP server {e.server} failed, continuing with others")

    # Execute in parallel
    mcp_tasks = [
        server.handle_query(query, context)
        for server in relevant_servers
    ]

    # Gather results with timeout
    mcp_results = await asyncio.gather(
        *mcp_tasks,
        timeout=10.0,  # 10 second max for MCP queries
        return_exceptions=True
    )

    # Synthesize successful results
