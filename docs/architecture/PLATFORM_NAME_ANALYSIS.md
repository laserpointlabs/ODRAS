# Platform Name Analysis
## Moving Beyond ODRAS

## The Problem with "ODRAS"

**ODRAS** = Ontology-Driven Requirements Analysis System

**Issues:**
- ❌ Too technical ("ontology" scares non-technical users)
- ❌ Too narrow ("requirements analysis" is just one use case)
- ❌ Too academic (sounds like research project)
- ❌ Acronym is not intuitive
- ❌ Doesn't convey the desktop/chat experience

**What users hear:**
- "Ontology" → "I don't know what that means, this isn't for me"
- "Requirements Analysis" → "I don't analyze requirements, I manage suppliers"
- "System" → "Sounds complicated and technical"

**What we need to convey:**
- Simple and accessible
- Works with your documents
- Helps you get work done
- AI-powered but grounded
- Desktop interface, not complicated

---

2. Descriptive of core value (documents → insights → action)
3. Professional and business-friendly
4. Not intimidating or technical
5. Available domain name (.com or .io)

**Nice to Have:**
1. Visual/metaphorical (helps users understand)
2. Unique enough to Google well
3. Works internationally (no cultural issues)
4. Sounds modern but not gimmicky
5. Can be a verb ("I'll Insight that" or "Let me Compass it")

## Alternative Naming Approaches

### Approach 1: Keep "ODRAS" as Foundation Name

**Concept:** ODRAS is the architecture/standard, product names are built on top

```
ODRAS (the standard architecture)
  ├─ Insight for Supply Chain
  ├─ Insight for Program Management
  ├─ Insight for Compliance
  └─ Insight for Customer Service
```

**Example:**
- Architecture: "Built on ODRAS"
- Product: "Insight - Powered by ODRAS"
- Marketing: Focus on "Insight", mention ODRAS in footnotes
- Technical docs: Reference ODRAS architecture

**Pros:**
- Preserves ODRAS for technical/architectural context
- New name for user-facing product
- Clear separation: standard vs application

### Approach 2: Retire "ODRAS" Completely

**Concept:** Full rebrand, ODRAS becomes historical

**Example:**
- New name: "Insight"
- GitHub repo: insight-platform (fork/rename from ODRAS)
- Documentation: "Formerly known as ODRAS"
- Legacy: Keep ODRAS for research citations

**Pros:**
- Clean break from technical origins
- Fresh start for business positioning
- Simpler messaging

**Cons:**
- Lose established name (though mainly in research)
- Need to migrate all documentation
