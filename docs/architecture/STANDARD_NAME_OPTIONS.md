# Standard Name Options

**Context:** We need a name for the standard architecture. ODRAS is one use case built on this standard.

---

## What the Standard Actually Is

**Core Principles:**
1. **File-Based** - Everything is files in folders (like Windows)
2. **Tool-Based** - Tools do one thing well (like command line)
3. **Extension-Based** - Extensions add functionality (like VS Code)
4. **Workflow-Based** - Workflows connect tools (like automation)

**Key Characteristics:**
- ✅ Standard file structure
- ✅ Standard tool interface (MCP)
- ✅ Standard extension format
- ✅ Standard workflow format (BPMN)
- ✅ Domain-agnostic (works for any domain)
- ✅ Extensible (anyone can build extensions)

**What It's NOT:**
- ❌ Not primarily about AI/intelligence (that's Continue.ai/Cursor)
- ❌ Not a platform you deploy (it's a standard you follow)
- ❌ Not a single system (it's an architecture pattern)

## Name Options

### Option 1: Structured Intelligence Platform (SIP)

**Pros:**
- ✅ "Structured" captures file organization
- ✅ "Platform" suggests extensibility
- ✅ "Intelligence" suggests smart tooling

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ "Intelligence" might imply AI is central (it's not - AI is external)
- ⚠️ "Platform" might imply a deployed system (it's a standard/pattern)
- ⚠️ Doesn't emphasize extensibility/tools

**Verdict:** Could work if we clarify "intelligence" = structured tool composition, not AI

---

### Option 2: Structured Extensible Platform (SEP)

**Pros:**
- ✅ "Structured" captures file organization
- ✅ "Extensible" emphasizes extensions/plugins
- ✅ "Platform" suggests foundation

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ "Platform" might imply a deployed system
- ⚠️ Doesn't emphasize tools/workflows

**Verdict:** Better than SIP - emphasizes extensibility

---

### Option 3: File-Based Extensible Architecture (FEA)

**Pros:**
- ✅ "File-Based" is clear and familiar
- ✅ "Extensible" emphasizes extensions
- ✅ "Architecture" is accurate (it's an architecture pattern)

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ "FEA" acronym might be confusing
- ⚠️ Doesn't emphasize tools/workflows

**Verdict:** Very descriptive but acronym is weak

---

### Option 4: Domain Extensible Architecture (DEA)

**Pros:**
- ✅ "Domain" emphasizes domain-specific tools
- ✅ "Extensible" emphasizes extensions
- ✅ "Architecture" is accurate

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ "DEA" acronym might be confusing (Drug Enforcement Agency)
- ⚠️ Doesn't emphasize file-based nature

**Verdict:** Good but acronym issue

---

### Option 5: Pluggable Domain Architecture (PDA)

**Pros:**
- ✅ "Pluggable" emphasizes extensions/plugins
- ✅ "Domain" emphasizes domain-specific
- ✅ "Architecture" is accurate

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ "PDA" acronym might be confusing (Personal Digital Assistant)
- ⚠️ Doesn't emphasize file-based nature

**Verdict:** Good but acronym issue

---

### Option 6: Extensible Tool Architecture (ETA)

**Pros:**
- ✅ "Extensible" emphasizes extensions
- ✅ "Tool" emphasizes tool-based nature
- ✅ "Architecture" is accurate

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ "ETA" acronym might be confusing (Estimated Time of Arrival)
- ⚠️ Doesn't emphasize file-based nature

**Verdict:** Good but acronym issue

---

### Option 7: Structured Tool Architecture (STA)

**Pros:**
- ✅ "Structured" captures file organization
- ✅ "Tool" emphasizes tool-based nature
- ✅ "Architecture" is accurate
- ✅ "STA" is a clean acronym

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Doesn't emphasize extensibility

**Verdict:** Clean but missing extensibility

---

### Option 8: Structured Extensible Tool Architecture (SETA)

**Pros:**
- ✅ "Structured" captures file organization
- ✅ "Extensible" emphasizes extensions
- ✅ "Tool" emphasizes tool-based nature
- ✅ "Architecture" is accurate
- ✅ Covers all key aspects

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Long name
- ⚠️ "SETA" acronym might be unfamiliar

**Verdict:** Most descriptive but long

---

## Recommendation

### If We Go with SIP (Structured Intelligence Platform):

**Clarify the meaning:**
- "Structured" = File-based organization
- "Intelligence" = Smart tool composition, not AI (AI is external via Continue.ai)
- "Platform" = Standard architecture/pattern

**Use it like:**
- "SIP Standard" or "SIP Architecture"
- "Built on SIP" or "SIP-compliant"
- "SIP extension" or "SIP tool"

### Alternative: Structured Extensible Architecture (SEA)

**Pros:**
- ✅ "Structured" = File-based
- ✅ "Extensible" = Extensions/plugins
- ✅ "Architecture" = Pattern/standard
- ✅ "SEA" is a clean acronym
- ✅ Doesn't imply AI/intelligence

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Doesn't explicitly mention tools

**Verdict:** Good balance - clear, clean, accurate

---

## My Take

**SIP could work IF:**
- We clarify "intelligence" = structured tool composition
- We emphasize it's a standard/architecture, not a platform you deploy
- We make clear AI comes from Continue.ai/Cursor, not SIP itself

**SEA might be better because:**
- More accurate (it's an architecture, not a platform)
- Clearer (doesn't imply AI)
- Cleaner acronym

**What matters most:**
- Does it communicate "file-based, tool-based, extension-based, workflow-based"?
- Does it sound professional?
- Is the acronym usable?

---

## Questions to Consider

1. **Is "intelligence" important?** 
   - If yes → SIP works
   - If no → SEA or SETA might be better

2. **Is "platform" accurate?**
   - If it's a deployed thing → Platform works
   - If it's a standard/pattern → Architecture is better

3. **What's the primary value?**
   - File organization → "Structured"
   - Extensibility → "Extensible"
   - Tool composition → "Tool"
   - All of the above → "Structured Extensible Tool Architecture (SETA)"

---

## Final Thoughts

**SIP (Structured Intelligence Platform)** could work, but consider:
- **SEA (Structured Extensible Architecture)** - More accurate, cleaner
- **SETA (Structured Extensible Tool Architecture)** - Most descriptive

**Recommendation:** Start with SIP if your buddy likes it, but be ready to clarify what "intelligence" means (structured tool composition, not AI).
