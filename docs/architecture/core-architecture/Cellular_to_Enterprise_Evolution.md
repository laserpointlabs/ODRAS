## Executive Summary

This document describes how **autonomous Project Cells** evolve into an **alive enterprise-level project network** through event-driven architecture, competency questions, and microtheories. This approach extends and fundamentally improves upon the traditional "digital thread" concept by making it **executable, validated, and event-driven** rather than static and document-based.

### The Core Problem Solved

**Traditional Digital Thread Failure:**
- Static, document-based links
- Not executable or validatable
- Breaks when underlying systems change
- Hard to maintain and verify
- Provides documentation but no real-time intelligence

**ODRAS Living Digital Thread:**
- Event-driven connections between cells
- Executable competency questions validate connections
- Microtheories provide isolated test contexts
- Auto-discovery through event bus
- Continual validation and gap analysis
- Truly "alive" network that responds to changes

## Stage 1: Autonomous Cells (WIRR Project)

### Initial State: Isolated Workbenches

**Starting Point:**
- WIRR Project Cell created
- Ontology Workbench: Create/import ontologies
- Conceptualizer: Build domain models
- Requirements Workbench: Capture requirements
- CQMT Workbench: Define competency questions

**Key Characteristics:**
- Each workbench operates independently
- No inter-workbench dependencies
- Local data only
- Manual validation

### Gruninger's Foundation: Activity Clusters

Based on Gruninger & Fox's TOVE ontology, each workbench activity is structured as an **activity cluster**:

**Activity Cluster Structure:**
- **Activity**: Basic transformational action primitive
- **Enabling States**: What must be true for activity to occur
- **Caused States**: What is true after activity completes
- **Terminal States**: `use`, `consume`, `release`, `produce`
- **Status Transitions**: `possible` → `committed` → `enabled` → `completed`

### Cell-Level Event Capture

  "workbench": "ontology",
  "data": {
    "class_iri": "http://usn/wirr/WeaponSystem",
    "layer": "L2"
  }
}

{
  "event_type": "competency_question.tested",
  "cell_id": "wirr-cell-001",
  "workbench": "cqmt",
  "data": {
    "cq_id": "cq-001",
    "status": "passed",
    "execution_time_ms": 1200
  }
}
```

---

## Stage 2: Competency Questions Drive Validation

### CQs Define Cell Capabilities

**Each Cell Develops Its Own CQ Set:**

```yaml
WIRR_Cell_CQs:
  # Entity Identification
  - "What weapon systems exist?"
  - "What platforms can carry weapons?"
  
  # Relationship Discovery
  - "How do weapons relate to platforms?"
  - "What are the integration constraints?"
  
  # Process Validation
  - "What integration processes exist?"
  - "How are integration issues resolved?"
  
  # Constraint Verification
  - "What certification rules apply?"
  - "What compatibility requirements exist?"
  
  # Temporal Projection (Gruninger's Core Task)
  - "Given integration actions at times T1-T5, what are weapon/platform properties at time T10?"
  - "What is the sequence of activities to complete integration?"
  - "Can we benchmark integration processes across projects?"
  - "What happens if we delay platform delivery by 2 weeks?"
  - "What are effects of unexpected weapon failure?"
  - "What is minimum cycle time for integration?"
```

### Gruninger's Mathematical Rigor

**CQs as Necessary and Sufficient Axioms:**

Each CQ must be provable as a theorem. The ontology contains **necessary and sufficient axioms** to answer the CQ. If any axiom is removed, the theorem cannot be proven.

**Successor State Axioms:**

Gruninger uses successor state axioms to solve temporal projection:

```first-order-logic
// For any action e, state s, activity a:
holds(status(s,a,enabled), do(e,σ)) ⟺ 
  (e = enable(s,a) ∧ holds(status(s,a,committed), σ)) ∨
  (holds(status(s,a,enabled), σ) ∧ 
   ¬(e = complete(s,a) ∨ e = disenable(s,a)))
```

**This solves the frame problem**: What changes? What stays the same?

### CQ Testing Against Microtheories

**Microtheories Provide Isolated Test Contexts:**

```yaml
Microtheory_WIRR_Baseline:
  purpose: "Baseline integration testing"
  named_graph: "http://localhost:3030/wirr/baseline"
  test_data:
    - ":weapon1 rdf:type :WeaponSystem"
    - ":platform1 rdf:type :Aircraft"
    - ":weapon1 :canBeCarriedBy :platform1"

Microtheory_WIRR_EdgeCase:
  purpose: "Test edge cases"
  named_graph: "http://localhost:3030/wirr/edgecase"
  test_data:
    - ":weapon2 rdf:type :WeaponSystem"
    - ":platform2 rdf:type :Aircraft"
    - ":weapon2 :weight 50000"  # Too heavy!
```

**CQ Execution:**
```sparql
# CQ: "What platforms can carry weapon X?"
SELECT ?platform WHERE {
  ?weapon rdf:type :WeaponSystem .
  ?weapon :canBeCarriedBy ?platform .
  FILTER(?weapon = :weapon1)
}
```

---

## Stage 3: Event-Driven Discovery

### Cell Publishes Events to Bus

**Key Event Types:**
- `cq.test.completed` - CQ validation results
- `ontology.layer.completed` - Ontology layer finished
- `microtheory.validated` - Microtheory tested
- `artifact.published` - Workbench artifact available
- `capability.declared` - Cell declares capabilities

**Event Bus Pattern:**
```python
# Event-driven discovery
class CellDiscovery:
    async def publish_capability(self, cell_id, capabilities):
        """Declare what this cell can do"""
        event = {
            "type": "capability.declared",
            "cell_id": cell_id,
            "capabilities": capabilities,
            "cq_coverage": ["entity_identification", "relationship_discovery"]
        }
        await self.event_bus.publish(event)
    
    async def discover_compatible_cells(self, my_cqs):
        """Find cells with compatible CQs"""
        candidates = await self.event_bus.subscribe(
            filter={"type": "capability.declared"}
        )
        # Find cells whose CQs complement ours
        return [c for c in candidates if self._cq_compatible(c['cq_coverage'], my_cqs)]
```

### Subscriber Cells Discover Opportunities

**Pattern Recognition:**
```python
# Mission Planning Cell discovers WIRR Cell
class MissionPlanningCell:
    async def on_capability_discovered(self, event):
        """Another cell declared capabilities"""
        if self._needs_capability(event):
            # Automatically subscribe to their events
            await self.subscribe_to_cell(event['cell_id'])
            
            # Validate integration using CQs
            integration_cqs = await self.generate_integration_cqs(event)
            await self.validate_integration(integration_cqs)
```

---

## Stage 4: Automated Connection & Validation

### Event-Driven Process Kickoff

**Scenario: WIRR Cell + Mission Planning Cell**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant WIRR as WIRR Cell
    participant EventBus as Event Bus
    participant Mission as Mission Planning Cell
    participant CQEngine as CQ Validator
    
    WIRR->>EventBus: Publish: capability.declared
    EventBus->>Mission: Notify: New capability available
    Mission->>Mission: Assess: Do I need this?
    Mission->>EventBus: Subscribe: WIRR weapon events
    Mission->>CQEngine: Generate integration CQs
    CQEngine->>CQEngine: Test compatibility
    CQEngine->>Mission: Return: Integration validated
    Mission->>EventBus: Publish: integration.established
    WIRR->>EventBus: Publish: weapon.system.deployed
    EventBus->>Mission: Trigger: Update mission plans
    Mission->>Mission: Execute: Process new data
```

### Automatic Integration Validation

**Integration CQs Generated:**

```yaml
Integration_CQs:
  # Can we query weapon capabilities?
  - cq: "What weapons are available for missions?"
    sparql: |
      SELECT ?weapon ?platform WHERE {
        ?weapon rdf:type :WeaponSystem .
        ?weapon :canBeCarriedBy ?platform .
      }
  
  # Do our ontologies align?
  - cq: "Are mission and weapon ontologies compatible?"
    sparql: |
      ASK {
        ?mission :requires ?weapon .
        ?weapon rdf:type :WeaponSystem .
      }
  
  # Can we flow parameters?
  - cq: "Can we retrieve weapon specifications?"
    sparql: |
      SELECT ?weapon ?weight ?range WHERE {
        ?weapon rdf:type :WeaponSystem .
        ?weapon :weight ?weight .
        ?weapon :effectiveRange ?range .
      }
```

**Validation Process:**
1. Generate integration CQs based on declared capabilities
2. Execute CQs against both cells' microtheories
3. If all pass → establish connection
4. If any fail → alert for manual review
5. Publish integration status event

---

## Stage 5: Living Digital Thread

### How This Extends Digital Thread

**Traditional Digital Thread (Broken):**
```
Requirement → Design → Implementation → Test
     ↓           ↓           ↓           ↓
   Document   Document   Document   Document
```
- Static links
- No validation
- Breaks when changed
- Not executable

**ODRAS Living Digital Thread:**
```
Requirement Cell → Design Cell → Implementation Cell → Test Cell
       ↓                ↓               ↓                  ↓
  Event Bus ← → Event Bus ← → Event Bus ← → Event Bus
       ↓                ↓               ↓                  ↓
   CQ Valid   CQ Valid   CQ Valid   CQ Valid
       ↓                ↓               ↓                  ↓
  Microtheory   Microtheory   Microtheory   Microtheory
```
- **Event-driven**: Changes propagate automatically
- **CQ-validated**: Connections verified continuously
- **Microtheory-tested**: Isolated validation contexts
- **Auto-discovery**: Cells find each other
- **Executable**: Real queries, real data, real validation

### Continuous Validation

**Living Thread Validation:**

```python
class LivingThreadValidator:
    async def validate_thread(self, thread_id):
        """Continuously validate digital thread"""
        cells = await self.get_thread_cells(thread_id)
        
        for source, target in self._get_cell_pairs(cells):
            # Generate connection CQs
            cqs = await self.generate_connection_cqs(source, target)
            
            # Execute validation
            results = await self.execute_cqs(cqs)
            
            # If validation fails, break thread
            if any(not r.passed for r in results):
                await self.alert_thread_broken(thread_id, source, target)
            else:
                await self.record_thread_valid(thread_id, source, target)
```

**Event: Thread Broken**
```json
{
  "event_type": "digital_thread.broken",
  "thread_id": "thread-req-design-impl",
  "broken_at": "cell-design-002",
  "reason": "Design ontology incompatible with requirements",
  "failed_cqs": ["cq-integration-001", "cq-integration-003"],
  "action_required": "manual_review"
}
```

---

## Stage 6: Enterprise-Level Patterns

### Gap Analysis Through CQs

**Automated Gap Detection:**

```python
class EnterpriseGapAnalyzer:
    async def analyze_gaps(self, enterprise_cqs):
        """Find gaps in enterprise coverage"""
        cell_cqs = await self.get_all_cell_cqs()
        
        # What enterprise CQs aren't covered?
        uncovered = enterprise_cqs - cell_cqs
        
        # What cells need to be added?
        required_cells = await self.determine_required_cells(uncovered)
        
        # Generate gap report
        return {
            "uncovered_cqs": uncovered,
            "required_cells": required_cells,
            "coverage_percentage": len(cell_cqs) / len(enterprise_cqs) * 100
        }
```

**Gap Analysis Events:**
```json
{
  "event_type": "enterprise.gap.detected",
  "enterprise_id": "enterprise-aircraft-acquisition",
  "missing_cqs": [
    "cq-sustainment-001",
    "cq-logistics-002"
  ],
  "suggested_cells": [
    {
      "cell_type": "sustainment",
      "layer": "L2",
      "required_cqs": ["cq-sustainment-001"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Parameter Flow Validation

**Cross-Cell Parameter Flow:**

```python
class ParameterFlowValidator:
    async def validate_flow(self, source_cell, target_cell, parameters):
        """Validate parameters can flow between cells"""
        
        # Generate CQs for parameter compatibility
        flow_cqs = []
        for param in parameters:
            cq = f"Can {source_cell} provide {param} in format {target_cell} expects?"
            flow_cqs.append(await self.generate_cq(cq))
        
        # Execute flow CQs
        results = await self.execute_cqs(flow_cqs)
        
        if all(r.passed for r in results):
            await self.establish_flow(source_cell, target_cell, parameters)
        else:
            await self.alert_flow_incompatible(source_cell, target_cell, results)
```

### Gruninger's Six Enterprise Tasks in ODRAS

Each stage incorporates Gruninger's enterprise engineering tasks:

**Stage 1 (Self-Validation):**
- **Temporal Projection**: CQs test what happens over time
- **Planning**: Sequence of activities to complete cell work

**Stage 2 (Discovery):**
- **Benchmarking**: Can this cell's activities be used by another?
- **Hypothetical Reasoning**: What if cells connect differently?

**Stage 3 (Connection):**
- **Execution Monitoring**: Event bus monitors real-time connections
- **Hypothetical Reasoning**: Validate "what-if" scenarios

**Stage 4 (Enterprise Network):**
- **Time-Based Competition**: Optimize cell interactions for speed
- **Temporal Projection**: Enterprise-wide temporal reasoning

## Why This Succeeds Where Digital Thread Failed

### Traditional Digital Thread Problems

| Problem | Traditional Approach | Result |
|---------|---------------------|--------|
| **Static Links** | Document references | Breaks when docs change |
| **No Validation** | Manual reviews | Errors accumulate |
| **Not Executable** | Text-based | Can't test connections |
| **Hard to Maintain** | Manual updates | Falls out of sync |
| **No Discovery** | Manual identification | Missed connections |
| **No Mathematical Basis** | Ad-hoc conventions | Not provable |

### ODRAS Living Thread Solutions

| Solution | ODRAS Approach | Result |
|----------|----------------|--------|
| **Event-Driven** | Cell publishes events | Auto-propagation |
| **CQ Validation** | Competency questions | Continuous verification |
| **Executable** | SPARQL queries | Real testing |
| **Auto-Maintain** | Event replay | Self-healing |
| **Auto-Discovery** | Event bus patterns | Finds opportunities |
| **Mathematical Rigor** | Successor state axioms | Provable theorems |

### Gruninger's Key Innovation: Necessary and Sufficient Axioms

**The Problem:** How do we know if an ontology is complete?
**The Answer:** CQs define what the ontology MUST answer, and we prove those axioms are necessary and sufficient.

**Theorem-Based Validation:**
```first-order-logic
Theorem: At any time t, state s, activity a, there exists status X such that:
T_successor ∪ T_occurrence ⊢ holds(status(s,a,X), t)

// If this theorem holds, we've proven temporal projection works
// If any axiom removed, theorem fails → axiom is necessary
```

**This is fundamentally different from**:
- Document traces (can't prove anything)
- Manual reviews (subject to human error)
- Ad-hoc conventions (not rigorous)

**ODRAS applies this rigor** through:
- CQ = theorem statement
- SPARQL = proof execution
- Success/failure = theorem validity

### Key Innovations

**1. CQs as Executable Specifications**
```python
# Not just documentation
CQ: "Can weapon X be carried by platform Y?"
# Executable validation
SPARQL: SELECT WHERE { :weaponX :canBeCarriedBy :platformY }
```

**2. Microtheories as Isolated Contexts**
```python
# Each cell tests independently
CellA_Microtheory: Test data for cell A
CellB_Microtheory: Test data for cell B
Integration_Microtheory: Combined test data
```

**3. Event Bus as Nervous System**
```python
# Cells communicate without direct knowledge
CellA → Event: "Weapon deployed"
Event → CellB: "Mission planning updated"
```

**4. Living Thread as Continuous Process**
```python
# Not a snapshot, a process
while True:
    validate_connections()
    detect_gaps()
    suggest_improvements()
    auto_heal()
```

## Practical Example: WIRR to Enterprise Network

### Phase 1: WIRR Cell Standalone

**Initial Setup:**
- Create WIRR Project Cell
- Import weapon system ontology
- Define 10 CQs
- Create baseline microtheory
- Test all CQs → 100% pass

**Events Published:**
- `cell.created`: WIRR Cell established
- `cq.completed`: 10/10 CQs passing
- `capability.declared`: Weapon integration expertise

### Phase 2: Mission Planning Cell Discovers WIRR

**Discovery Process:**
1. Mission Planning Cell publishes `capability.declared`
2. Event bus routes to all subscribers
3. WIRR Cell subscribes to mission events
4. Mission Planning Cell discovers WIRR events
5. Both cells assess compatibility

**Integration CQs Generated:**
- "Can mission planning query weapon capabilities?"
- "Are ontology concepts compatible?"
- "Can we flow mission parameters to weapons?"

**Validation:**
- Execute integration CQs against combined microtheory
- All pass → connection established
- Events continue to flow

### Phase 3: Integration Test Cell Added

**New Cell Discovery:**
- Integration Test Cell needs weapon data
- Subscribes to WIRR and Mission Planning events
- Generates test scenarios from event data
- Publishes test results

**Network Effect:**
```
WIRR ← → Mission Planning ← → Integration Test
  ↓                                    ↓
  └────────────────────────────────────┘
          (via event bus)
```

### Phase 4: Enterprise-Level Patterns Emerge

**Auto-Discovered Patterns:**
- Weapon integration → Mission planning → Testing
- Requirements → Design → Validation
- Ontology → Conceptualizer → Requirements

**Gap Analysis:**
- Enterprise CQ: "What sustainment requirements exist?"
- Current Coverage: 0% (no sustainment cell)
- Recommendation: Create Sustainment Cell

**Living Thread Established:**
- Full traceability through events
- Continuous validation through CQs
- Auto-healing when connections break
- Gap detection identifies missing cells

## Conclusion

The evolution from isolated Project Cells to an alive enterprise network represents a fundamental shift from **static documentation** to **executable intelligence**. By combining:

1. **Competency Questions** as executable specifications
2. **Microtheories** as isolated test contexts
3. **Event Bus** as nervous system
4. **Living Digital Thread** as continuous process

ODRAS creates an enterprise system that **discovers itself, validates itself, and evolves itself**. This is not just a digital thread—it's a **living organism** of connected, validated, intelligent cells that make the enterprise truly executable.

**Key Achievement:** Where traditional digital threads document what happened, ODRAS's living thread **validates what is** and **discovers what could be**.

## Appendix: Key Terms and Definitions

### Formal Logic and Mathematical Foundations

#### First-Order Logic (FOL)
A formal system for expressing statements about objects and their relationships using:
- Constants, variables, predicates, functions
- Logical connectives (∧, ∨, ¬, →, ↔)
- Quantifiers (∀, ∃)

Provides the mathematical foundation for proving competency questions as theorems.

#### Axioms
Assertions assumed true without proof. Types include:
- **Definitional**: Define concepts
- **Assertional**: State facts
- **Successor State**: Specify state changes over time

Must be **necessary and sufficient**—removing any breaks theorems.

#### Competency Questions (CQs)
Natural language questions an ontology must answer. Structure:
- Natural language question
- Formalization (first-order logic or SPARQL)
- Validation contract

Each CQ is a provable theorem.

#### Microtheories (MTs)
Isolated named graphs in Fuseki for testing CQs. Characteristics:
- Isolated contexts
- Named graph URIs
- Test data only
- Independent evaluation

#### Successor State Axioms
Axioms specifying how states change over time. Solve the **frame problem**:
```first-order-logic
holds(status(s,a,enabled), do(e,σ)) ⟺ 
  (e = enable(s,a) ∧ holds(status(s,a,committed), σ)) ∨
  (holds(status(s,a,enabled), σ) ∧ 
   ¬(e = complete(s,a) ∨ e = disenable(s,a)))

#### Activity Clusters
Gruninger's foundation for processes:
- Activity (transformation primitive)
- Enabling states (preconditions)
- Caused states (postconditions)
- Terminal states: `use`, `consume`, `release`, `produce`
- Status transitions: `possible` → `committed` → `enabled` → `completed`

#### Frame Problem
Determining what changes vs. stays the same when actions occur. Solved by successor state axioms.

### Enterprise Engineering Tasks (Gruninger & Fox)

1. **Temporal Projection**: Properties of resources/activities over time
2. **Planning and Scheduling**: Activity sequences and timing
3. **Benchmarking**: Cross-enterprise activity comparison
4. **Hypothetical Reasoning**: What-if analysis
5. **Execution Monitoring**: Real-time adaptation to events
6. **Time-Based Competition**: Minimize cycle time, maximize concurrency

### ODRAS-Specific Terms

#### Project Cell
Fundamental atomic unit encapsulating models, evidence, requirements, metrics, and provenance.

#### Event Bus
Publish/subscribe messaging (Redis/NATS/Kafka) for decoupled cell communication.

#### Data & Event Workbench (DMW)
Centralized repository: Event Log (Postgres), Artifact Registry (Minio), Connectors.

#### Living Digital Thread
Event-driven, CQ-validated, executable traceability (vs. static document-based).
