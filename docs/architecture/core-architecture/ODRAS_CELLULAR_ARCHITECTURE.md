# ODRAS Cellular Architecture: A System of Systems Approach

## Overview

ODRAS implements a **cellular architecture** where individual **Project Cells** operate as semi-autonomous units that communicate through an **event-driven publish/subscribe** pattern. This design enables complex **systems of systems** where projects can share data, requirements, and artifacts dynamically.

## Core Concepts

### Project Cell

A **Project Cell** is the fundamental atomic unit of work in ODRAS. Each cell encapsulates:

**Internal State:**
- **Models**: Domain models, ontologies, data structures
- **Evidence**: Supporting documentation, test results, validation data
- **Derived Requirements**: Requirements generated within the cell
- **Satisfaction**: Metrics, compliance status, acceptance criteria
- **Provenance**: Audit trail, change history, lineage

**Operational Modes:**
- **TESTING (BLAST Radius)**: Validation and impact analysis
- **Production**: Live operational state
- **Digital Assistance System (DAS)**: AI-powered assistance within the cell

### Inputs to Project Cell

Cells receive structured inputs:

- **Allocated Requirements**: Requirements assigned from parent systems
- **Policies**: Governance rules, standards, constraints
- **CORE Knowledge**: Domain knowledge, ontologies, best practices
- **Data/Params**: Configuration data, parameters, external data sources
- **Events**: Real-time events from other cells or external systems

### Outputs from Project Cell

Cells produce structured outputs:

- **Results/DATA**: Processed data, analysis results, computed values
- **Derived Requirements**: New requirements generated by the cell
- **Artifacts**: Documents, reports, deliverables
- **Impact Report**: Change impact analysis
- **Events**: Published events signaling state changes

### Publish/Subscribe Mechanism

**Event Stream Integration:**
- **SUB (Subscribe)**: Cells subscribe to relevant event streams
- **Pub (Publish)**: Cells publish events to event streams
- **Decoupled Communication**: Cells don't need direct knowledge of each other

**Example Use Case - FEA Data Sharing:**
```
1. FEA Project Cell publishes "FEA Results" event with:
   - Margin calculations
   - Load distributions
   - Stress analysis data
   
2. Reporting Project Cell subscribes and uses for:
   - Performance dashboards
   - Executive summaries
   
3. Design Optimization Project Cell subscribes and uses for:
   - Iterative design improvements
   - Sensitivity analysis
   
4. System Integration Project Cell subscribes and uses for:
   - Interface requirements validation
   - Cross-component compatibility checks
```

## Formal Architectural Patterns

### System of Systems (SoS)

**Definition:** A collection of constituent systems that are independent and useful in their own right, but together form a more complex system.

**In ODRAS:**
- Each Project Cell is a constituent system
- Cells collaborate to achieve higher-level goals
- Example: Weapons Integration Program consists of multiple project cells (requirements, design, testing, integration)

**Characteristics:**
- **Operational Independence**: Each cell can function alone
- **Managerial Independence**: Each cell can be managed separately
- **Evolutionary Development**: Cells evolve independently
- **Emergent Behavior**: System-level properties emerge from cell interactions

### Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)

**Definition:** Architecture pattern where components communicate via events, published to an event stream, to which other components can subscribe.

**In ODRAS:**
- Cells publish events (data updates, status changes, completions)
- Cells subscribe to events of interest
- Event bus facilitates routing and delivery
- Decouples producers from consumers

**Key Benefits:**
- **Loose Coupling**: Cells don't need direct dependencies
- **Scalability**: Add new subscribers without modifying publishers
- **Flexibility**: Dynamic data flows based on needs
- **Real-time Updates**: Subscribers get immediate notifications

### Publish/Subscribe Pattern

**Definition:** Messaging pattern where senders (publishers) don't program messages for specific receivers (subscribers). Messages are published without knowledge of subscribers.

**In ODRAS:**
- FEA cell publishes margins/loads without knowing who needs them
- Reporting cells subscribe to relevant data streams
- Workspace cells connect via shared subscriptions

**Subscription Patterns:**
- **Topic-based**: Subscribe to specific event types
- **Content-based**: Subscribe based on event content
- **Context-based**: Subscribe based on project relationships

### Domain-Driven Design (DDD) - Bounded Contexts

**What is DDD?**

**Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** is a software development approach introduced by Eric Evans that focuses on:
- Modeling software to match the **real-world domain** it serves
- Using **ubiquitous language** (terms everyone understands)
- Organizing code around **business capabilities**, not technical layers
- Building systems that **domain experts can understand**

**Key DDD Philosophy:**
- **Domain experts and developers work together** using shared language
- **Complex domain logic is at the heart** of the software
- **Architecture reflects domain structure**, not just technical convenience

**What is a Bounded Context?**

A **Bounded Context** is a **logical boundary** where a particular domain model (vocabulary, rules, concepts) applies consistently.

**Think of it like this:**
- Inside the boundary: Everyone uses the same definitions
- Outside the boundary: Different words might mean different things
- **Boundary = Clear scope** where domain model is valid

**Real-World Example:**

**Without Bounded Context (Chaos):**
```
Marketing Team: "Customer" = anyone who visits website
Sales Team: "Customer" = anyone who made a purchase  
Accounting Team: "Customer" = anyone who owes us money
Support Team: "Customer" = anyone with active contract

→ Same word, different meanings = confusion, bugs, disputes
```

**With Bounded Context (Order):**
```
Marketing Context:
  - "Customer" = Visitor (website visitor)
  - Own vocabulary: Leads, Conversion, Campaigns
  
Sales Context:
  - "Customer" = Buyer (completed purchase)
  - Own vocabulary: Prospects, Quotas, Deals
  
Accounting Context:
  - "Customer" = Debtor (has outstanding balance)
  - Own vocabulary: Invoices, Payments, Ledgers
  
Support Context:
  - "Customer" = Subscriber (active service)
  - Own vocabulary: Tickets, SLAs, Contracts

→ Each context has clear, consistent definitions within its boundary
```

**Bounded Context Characteristics:**

1. **Owns Domain Model**
   - Has its own definitions for entities, value objects, aggregates
   - Models the domain as understood by that team/context

2. **Ubiquitous Language**
   - Shared vocabulary used by both domain experts and developers
   - Code uses domain terms, not technical terms

3. **Clear Boundaries**
   - Explicit border where context ends
   - Rules and assumptions only apply inside boundary

4. **Independent Evolution**
   - Can change its model without affecting other contexts
   - Owns its own database, models, logic

**How Bounded Context Applies to ODRAS Project Cells:**

Each **Project Cell IS a Bounded Context**:

**FEA Project Cell as Bounded Context:**
```
Boundary: Structural analysis domain
Ubiquitous Language: 
  - "Margin" = Factor of safety ratio
  - "Load" = Applied force/stress
  - "Failure" = Exceeds material limits
  
Own Models:
  - Structural models
  - Material properties
  - Analysis methods
  
Own Rules:
  - Safety margins must be > 1.5
  - Load cases must consider all conditions
  - Results must include uncertainty bounds
```

**Requirements Project Cell as Bounded Context:**
```
Boundary: Requirements engineering domain
Ubiquitous Language:
  - "Requirement" = System capability specification
  - "Stakeholder" = Anyone affected by system
  - "Traceability" = Requirement-to-implementation link
  
Own Models:
  - Requirements ontology
  - Stakeholder models
  - Traceability graphs
  
Own Rules:
  - Requirements must be testable
  - Requirements must link to stakeholders
  - Requirements must have acceptance criteria
```

**Integration Project Cell as Bounded Context:**
```
Boundary: System integration domain
Ubiquitous Language:
  - "Interface" = Connection point between systems
  - "Contract" = Interface specification
  - "Compatibility" = Systems work together
  
Own Models:
  - Interface specifications
  - Integration architecture
  - Compatibility matrices
  
Own Rules:
  - Interfaces must have version contracts
  - Changes must maintain backward compatibility
  - Integration must pass compatibility tests
```

**Why This Matters for ODRAS:**

**Problem Without Bounded Contexts:**
```
"Requirement" might mean:
- In Requirements Cell: Business need
- In Design Cell: Technical specification
- In Test Cell: Test case criteria
- In Documentation Cell: User story

→ Confusion, misunderstandings, bugs
```

**Solution With Bounded Contexts:**
```
Each Project Cell:
- Has clear, consistent definitions
- Owns its models and rules
- Communicates through well-defined interfaces
- Can evolve independently

→ Clarity, maintainability, scalability
```

**Context Mapping - How Contexts Relate:**

**Upstream/Downstream:**
- **Upstream**: Cell that produces data others need
- **Downstream**: Cell that consumes upstream data
- Example: FEA Cell → Reporting Cell (upstream → downstream)

**Shared Kernel:**
- Common concepts shared across contexts
- Carefully managed to avoid coupling
- Example: "Project ID" concept shared by all cells

**Conformist:**
- Downstream cell follows upstream cell's model
- Example: Reporting Cell conforms to FEA Cell's data structure

**Anti-Corruption Layer:**
- Protection layer between contexts
- Translates between different models
- Example: Adapter translating FEA data for reporting

**Customer/Supplier:**
- Upstream cell serves downstream cell
- Downstream cell's needs drive upstream development
- Example: Integration Cell depends on FEA Cell for results

**The Critical Question: Do Ontologies Bridge Bounded Contexts?**

**Short Answer:** Yes, but carefully. Ontologies serve different roles within vs. between contexts.

**Within a Bounded Context:**
```
Each Project Cell has its OWN ontology:
- Defines the domain model for that context
- Establishes ubiquitous language
- Owns the semantics and rules
- Example: FEA Cell has "FEA Ontology" with Margin, Load, Failure concepts
```

**Between Bounded Contexts (The Bridge):**

**Option 1: Shared Kernel Ontology**
```
Multiple cells SHARE a common ontology for basic concepts:
- Common concepts: ProjectID, Timestamp, Version
- Managed carefully to avoid coupling
- Changes require coordination across cells
- Example: All cells share "Core Project Ontology"

Risk: Can create tight coupling between contexts
```

**Option 2: Mapping/Translation Ontologies**
```
Each context translates between its own ontology and others:
- FEA Cell: Own "FEA Ontology" 
- Mapping Ontology: "FEA-to-Reporting Ontology"
- Reporting Cell: Own "Reporting Ontology"
- Translation happens at boundary (anti-corruption layer)

Benefit: Maintains context independence
```

**Option 3: Integration Ontology**
```
A separate ontology that combines concepts from multiple contexts:
- Integrated Ontology: Merges concepts from FEA + Requirements + Integration
- Used for cross-cutting concerns
- Serves as integration model
- Cells translate to/from integration ontology

Benefit: Enables system-level analysis while preserving cell autonomy
```

**How This Works in ODRAS:**

**Within Cell (Owned Ontology):**
```
FEA Project Cell:
├─ Owns: "FEA Ontology"
│   ├─ Concepts: Margin, Load, Stress, Material
│   ├─ Rules: Safety factors, Analysis methods
│   └─ Language: FEA-specific terminology
└─ Independent: Can change without affecting other cells
```

**Between Cells (Shared/Bridge Ontologies):**
```
Integration Layer:
├─ Shared Kernel: "Core Project Ontology"
│   └─ Common: ProjectID, Status, Version
│
├─ Mapping Ontologies:
│   ├─ "FEA-to-Reporting Mapping"
│   ├─ "Requirements-to-Integration Mapping"
│   └─ Translation rules between contexts
│
└─ Integration Ontology:
    └─ "System Integration Ontology"
        └─ Combined view for system-level analysis
```

**Publish/Subscribe via Ontologies:**

**What Gets Published:**
```
FEA Cell publishes:
├─ Data: Margins, Loads (from FEA Ontology)
├─ Metadata: Ontology schema version
└─ Event: "fea_results" event type

Cells that subscribe:
├─ Receive data conforming to FEA Ontology
├─ Option 1: Use FEA Ontology directly (conformist)
├─ Option 2: Translate to own ontology (anti-corruption layer)
└─ Option 3: Map to integration ontology (federated view)
```

**Practical Example:**
```
FEA Cell publishes margins using "FEA Ontology"

├─ Reporting Cell subscribes:
│   ├─ Uses: Direct conformist to FEA Ontology
│   └─ Displays FEA data as-is
│
├─ Integration Cell subscribes:
│   ├─ Uses: Translation mapping
│   ├─ Owns: "Integration Ontology"
│   └─ Translates FEA concepts to integration concepts
│       - "Margin" (FEA) → "Safety Factor" (Integration)
│
└─ System Analysis Cell subscribes:
    ├─ Uses: Integration Ontology
    └─ Combines data from multiple cells
```

**Best Practices for ODRAS:**

1. **Each Cell Owns Its Ontology**
   - FEA Cell owns FEA Ontology
   - Requirements Cell owns Requirements Ontology
   - Don't force shared ontology across contexts

2. **Use Ontologies to Bridge, Not Break Boundaries**
   - Shared Kernel: Minimal common concepts only
   - Mapping Ontologies: Translate at boundaries
   - Integration Ontology: Separate concern for system-level views

3. **Event Publishing Includes Ontology Context**
   ```
   Event schema:
   {
     "data": {...},
     "source_ontology": "FEA_Ontology_v2.1",
     "ontology_schema": "...",
     "translation_hints": {...}
   }
   ```

4. **Subscribers Choose Translation Strategy**
   - Conformist: Accept sender's ontology
   - Anti-Corruption: Translate to own ontology
   - Federated: Map to integration ontology

**Summary:**
- **DDD** = Build software around domain knowledge
- **Bounded Context** = Logical boundary where a domain model applies
- **Project Cell** = Each cell is a bounded context
- **Clear boundaries** = Each cell has its own language, models, rules
- **Safe communication** = Cells connect through well-defined interfaces
- **Ontologies** = Bridge contexts through Shared Kernel, Mapping, or Integration ontologies
- **Each cell owns its ontology** = Maintains independence
- **Translation happens at boundaries** = Prevents coupling

### ODRAS Layered Ontology Architecture

**Multi-Level Vertical Integration Pattern**

ODRAS implements a **layered ontology architecture** where concepts flow vertically from abstract (core) to concrete (applied), creating natural bounded contexts at each level.

**The Layered Structure:**

```
Applied Layer (L3)
├─ Individuals: Actual trade studies, specific implementations
├─ Examples: "Lockheed F-35 Weapons Integration Study", "Bell V-280 Component Design"
└─ Bounds: Concrete instances in specific projects

L2 - Strategic/Architectural Layer
├─ Architectures: System architectures, trade definitions
├─ Examples: "Weapons Integration Architecture", "Component Trade Study Template"
└─ Bounds: Architectural patterns, trade study frameworks

L1 - Strategic/Tactical Layer  
├─ Processes: Requirements, processes, workflows
├─ Examples: "Requirements Engineering Process", "Vendor Evaluation Process"
└─ Bounds: Strategic capabilities, domain processes

Core Layer (L0)
├─ Foundational: Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), upper-level concepts
├─ Examples: Processes, Requirements, Components (abstract concepts)
└─ Bounds: Universal concepts applicable across all domains
```

**How This Creates Bounded Contexts:**

**Level 0: Core (Universal Bounded Context)**
```
Boundary: Universal concepts applicable everywhere
Ontology: BFO or similar foundational ontology
Concepts: Entity, Process, Requirement (abstract)
Owners: Ontology team / Core infrastructure
Changes: Rare, affects everything
```

**Level 1: Strategic Bounded Context**
```
Boundary: Strategic domain (e.g., Systems Engineering)
Ontology: L1 Systems Engineering Ontology
Concepts: Requirements, Processes, Stakeholders
Owners: Domain architects
Changes: Strategic decisions
```

**Level 2: Architectural Bounded Context**
```
Boundary: Architectural patterns (e.g., Integration, Design)
Ontology: L2 Architecture Ontology
Concepts: Integration Architectures, Trade Definitions
Owners: Technical architects
Changes: Architectural evolution
```

**Level 3: Applied Bounded Context (Project Cells)**
```
Boundary: Specific project instances
Ontology: Applied Ontology (instances of L1/L2)
Concepts: "Lockheed F-35 Integration", "Component Trade Study #42"
Owners: Project teams
Changes: Frequent, project-specific
```

**Flow of Concepts (Top-Down Integration):**

```
Core (BFO)
│
├─ Defines: Universal concepts (Process, Entity, etc.)
│
L1 (Strategic Systems Engineering)
│
├─ Extends Core: Refines Process → Requirements Engineering Process
├─ Adds: Strategic concepts (Requirements, Stakeholders, Capabilities)
│
L2 (Architectural)
│
├─ Extends L1: Refines Requirements → Integration Requirements
├─ Adds: Architectural concepts (Architectures, Trade Studies, Components)
│
Applied (Project Cell - FEA)
│
├─ Extends L2: Instantiates Trade Study → "FEA Trade Study #42"
├─ Adds: Individual concepts (Margin=1.67, Load=8500N, Material=Ti6Al4V)
└─ Bounded: Specific to FEA project cell
```

**How Project Cells Use Layered Ontologies:**

**FEA Project Cell Example:**
```
Imports:
├─ Core Ontology: Process, Entity, Requirement (concepts)
├─ L1 Ontology: Requirements Engineering Process (strategic)
├─ L2 Ontology: Component Trade Study (architectural)
└─ Creates: Applied individuals (specific FEA trade study)

Bounded Context:
├─ Owns: Individuals created within cell
├─ Uses: Concepts from L0, L1, L2 (through imports)
├─ Cannot change: Core, L1, L2 (read-only imports)
└─ Changes: Only cell-specific individuals
```

**Integration Between Layers:**

**Import Pattern:**
```
Applied Ontology imports L2 Ontology
L2 Ontology imports L1 Ontology  
L1 Ontology imports Core Ontology

Each layer:
├─ Adds concepts to lower layer
├─ Refines concepts from lower layer
├─ Creates bounded context at that level
└─ Owns concepts added at that level
```

**Version Control Across Layers:**
```
Core: Version 1.0 (stable)
├─ L1: Version 2.1 (depends on Core 1.0)
│   ├─ L2: Version 3.5 (depends on L1 2.1)
│   │   └─ Applied: Version 4.2 (depends on L2 3.5)
│   └─ Updated L1 to 2.2? 
│       └─ L2 and Applied must update dependencies
```

**Benefits of Layered Architecture:**

✅ **Natural Boundaries**
- Each layer is a bounded context
- Clear ownership and responsibilities
- Independent evolution at each level

✅ **Concept Inheritance**
- Lower layers inherit from upper layers
- Reduces duplication
- Maintains consistency

✅ **Domain Flexibility**
- L1 can specialize by domain (Systems Engineering, Manufacturing, etc.)
- L2 can specialize by capability (Integration, Testing, etc.)
- Applied can specialize by project

✅ **Project Cell Autonomy**
- Cells work at Applied level
- Own their individuals
- Don't affect upper layers

✅ **Scalability**
- Add new L1 domains without touching Core
- Add new L2 capabilities without touching L1
- Add new applied instances without touching L2

**Example: Weapons Integration Program**

```
Core (BFO)
├─ Process, Entity, Requirement

L1 Systems Engineering  
├─ Requirements Engineering Process
├─ Stakeholder Management Process
└─ System Lifecycle Process

L2 Weapons Integration
├─ Weapons Integration Architecture
├─ Integration Trade Study Framework
└─ Interface Requirements Template

Applied - Project Cells:
├─ FEA Cell: Uses L2 concepts, creates FEA individuals
├─ Requirements Cell: Uses L1 concepts, creates requirement individuals
├─ Integration Cell: Uses L2 concepts, creates integration individuals
└─ Testing Cell: Uses L1/L2 concepts, creates test individuals
```

**Publish/Subscribe with Layered Ontologies:**

**Event Publishing from FEA Cell:**
```
FEA Cell publishes:
{
  "data": {
    "margin": 1.67,
    "load": 8500,
    "material": "Ti6Al4V"
  },
  "ontology_context": {
    "core_version": "BFO_1.0",
    "l1_version": "SE_2.1",
    "l2_version": "WI_3.5",
    "applied_version": "FEA_Cell_4.2"
  },
  "concept_hierarchy": {
    "individual": "FEA_Trade_Study_42",
    "instance_of": "Component_Trade_Study", // L2
    "uses_process": "Requirements_Engineering", // L1
    "is_a": "Process" // Core
  }
}
```

**Subscriber Translation:**
```
Reporting Cell subscribes:
├─ Receives: FEA data with full context
├─ Can query: Across any layer (Core → Applied)
├─ Understands: Complete concept hierarchy
└─ Uses: Appropriate level for reporting

Example Query:
- Core level: "Show me all Processes"
- L1 level: "Show me Requirements Engineering Processes"
- L2 level: "Show me Component Trade Studies"
- Applied level: "Show me FEA Trade Study #42"
```

**Key Architectural Principles:**

1. **Vertical Import Only**
   - Applied imports L2, L2 imports L1, L1 imports Core
   - No horizontal imports within same layer
   - No circular dependencies

2. **Concept Refinement**
   - Each layer refines concepts from lower layer
   - Core: Generic → L1: Strategic → L2: Architectural → Applied: Specific

3. **Ownership Hierarchy**
   - Core: Universal ownership
   - L1: Domain ownership
   - L2: Capability ownership
   - Applied: Project ownership

4. **Change Propagation**
   - Changes in Core affect all layers
   - Changes in L1 affect L2 and Applied
   - Changes in L2 affect Applied only
   - Changes in Applied affect nothing else

**Summary:**

- **Layered Ontology Architecture** = Multi-level bounded contexts
- **Core (L0)** = Universal foundation (BFO)
- **L1** = Strategic domain (Requirements, Processes)
- **L2** = Architectural patterns (Architectures, Trade Studies)
- **Applied (L3)** = Project instances (Individuals)
- **Each layer is a bounded context** with its own ownership
- **Concepts flow downward** through imports
- **Project Cells operate at Applied level** with read-only access to upper layers
- **Natural boundaries** prevent coupling between contexts

### Microservices Architecture

**Definition:** Architectural style that structures applications as collections of loosely coupled services.

**In ODRAS:**
- Each Project Cell could be implemented as a microservice
- Cells communicate via well-defined APIs and events
- Independent deployment and scaling
- API gateway routes requests to appropriate cells

**Characteristics:**
- **Decentralized Governance**: Each cell owns its technology stack
- **Fault Isolation**: Failure in one cell doesn't cascade
- **Independent Evolution**: Cells update independently

## Shadow Cell: Impact Analysis Before Production

### Concept

A **Shadow Cell** is a parallel, non-production environment that performs impact analysis using publish/subscribe mechanisms before changes are implemented in production cells.

**Purpose:**
- Analyze potential impacts of changes (BLAST Radius analysis)
- Test integration points without affecting production
- Validate data flows between cells
- Identify unintended consequences

**Operation:**
```
1. Changes proposed to Project Cell
2. Shadow Cell created as copy
3. Shadow Cell subscribes to relevant event streams
4. Changes applied in Shadow Cell
5. Impact analysis performed:
   - What events are published?
   - Who receives those events?
   - What changes ripple through system?
6. Results inform go/no-go decision
7. If approved, changes applied to production cell
```

**Benefits:**
- Risk mitigation
- Change validation
- Systemic impact understanding
- Safe experimentation

## Project Cell Relationships

### Hierarchical Structure

**Parents:**
- Provide overarching requirements and policies
- Establish system boundaries
- Coordinate child cells
- Connection via "Provides" relationship

**Children:**
- Inherit parent requirements
- Contribute results upward
- Publish to parent shadow cells for analysis
- Connection via "Publishes" relationship

### Peer Relationships

**External Project Cells:**
- Cells from other programs or domains
- Connected via "Similar to" relationships
- Can subscribe to shared event streams
- Enable cross-program knowledge sharing

### Context Mapping

**Relationships:**
- **Upstream/Downstream**: Data flow direction
- **Similar to**: Peer cells with comparable concerns
- **Derives from**: Inheritance of requirements/models
- **Integrates with**: Direct integration points

## Knowledge Graph Network

### Concept

ODRAS cells form a **knowledge graph** where:
- Nodes = Project Cells
- Edges = Data flows, subscriptions, relationships
- Attributes = Cell state, capabilities, data schemas

**Properties:**
- **Nodes**: Each cell has unique identity and capabilities
- **Edges**: Directed or undirected based on relationship type
- **Attributes**: Rich metadata about cells and connections
- **Graph Queries**: Discover dependencies, data flows, impact chains

### Federated Knowledge System

**Definition:** A system where knowledge is distributed across multiple autonomous sites, with a federation layer that enables coordinated access.

**In ODRAS:**
- Each Project Cell is an autonomous knowledge site
- Cells publish their knowledge schemas
- Federation layer enables cross-cell queries
- Consistent access patterns across distributed cells

## Agent-Based System

### Concept

If DAS within cells acts with autonomy, the system exhibits **agent-based** characteristics:

**Agent Properties:**
- **Autonomy**: Agents operate without direct human intervention
- **Reactivity**: Agents respond to events in their environment
- **Proactiveness**: Agents take initiative to achieve goals
- **Social Ability**: Agents communicate with other agents (via pub/sub)

**Multi-Agent Coordination:**
- Each Project Cell could be an agent
- Agents coordinate via event-driven communication
- Emergent system behavior from agent interactions
- Self-organizing capabilities

## Implementation Considerations

### Event Schema Design

**Required Attributes:**
- **Event Type**: Category of event (data_update, status_change, etc.)
- **Source Cell**: Identity of publishing cell
- **Timestamp**: When event occurred
- **Data Payload**: Actual event data
- **Metadata**: Schema version, format, compression

**Example Event Schema:**
```json
{
  "event_type": "fea_results",
  "source_cell": "fea_project_001",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "data": {
    "margins": {...},
    "loads": {...},
    "metadata": {...}
  },
  "schema_version": "1.0"
}
```

### Subscription Management

**Subscription Types:**
- **Persistent**: Long-lived subscriptions
- **Temporary**: Short-lived, task-specific subscriptions
- **Conditional**: Only receive events matching criteria
- **Group**: Multiple cells subscribe as a group

**Subscription Examples:**
- Report all FEA results
- Report only FEA results exceeding threshold
- Report when specific project completes
- Report any changes to requirements ontology

### Data Versioning

**Challenge:** Cells evolve independently; data schemas change

**Solutions:**
- **Schema Registry**: Central registry of data schemas
- **Versioned Events**: Events include schema version
- **Backward Compatibility**: Support multiple schema versions
- **Migration Paths**: Tooling to migrate between versions

### Cell Lifecycle Management

**States:**
- **Created**: Cell initialized, not yet operational
- **Active**: Cell operational, processing work
- **Suspended**: Cell paused, not processing
- **Archived**: Cell completed, read-only access
- **Deleted**: Cell removed from system

**Transitions:**
- Creation → Active (when first work items added)
- Active → Suspended (manual pause or resource constraints)
- Suspended → Active (resume operations)
- Active → Archived (work completed)
- Archived → Deleted (retention period expired)

## Use Cases
