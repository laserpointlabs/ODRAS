# MVP: Vendor Evaluation Workflow - Development Plan

## Overview
Complete the MVP workflow for evaluating vendor configurations (Bell, Lockheed) against our requirements using ODRAS ontology-driven conceptualization, requirements mapping, and tabularizer capabilities.

**Critical Vision:** This MVP must establish patterns that make ODRAS generic and flexible enough to support ANY domain - from aircraft acquisition programs to trading platforms that execute strategies, react to events, and execute trades. Both use cases share similar workflow and event-driven architecture needs.

**Future Vision - DAS Bootstrapping:** With proper knowledge priming, DAS could potentially bootstrap entire systems in a self-organizing manner. For example, DAS could create a weapons integration program by generating projects, ontologies, knowledge assets, and concepts autonomously. As capabilities are added, DAS could create modeling, simulation, and analysis projects, connect them together, and run a live "system of systems." This is aspirational but should inform MVP architecture.

## Key Workflow Points

**Critical Correction:** The ontology is created BEFORE conceptualization, not from it. The ontology guides DAS conceptualization.

**Corrected Process Flow:**
1. **Ontology First:** Create bseo_v1 ontology before requirements processing
2. **Requirements Import:** Add requirements document file
3. **Requirements Extraction:** Extract in Requirements Workbench
4. **Requirements Mapping:** Map extracted data to bseo_v1 ontology classes via Data Management Workbench (must be flexible to map anything to anything)
5. **Conceptualization:** Run conceptualizer guided by ontology classes
6. **Concept Review:** Review extracted individuals and squash like entities (airplane, aircraft, etc.)
7. **Material Solution Ontology:** Create material_solution/vendor_solution class in separate ontology
8. **Tabularizer:** Create generic, flexible tables for evaluation criteria (e.g., Components vs vendor_solution)
9. **Reporting:** Generate white papers identifying gaps and material solution potentials

## Critical Missing Elements for Generic Platform Vision

### What's Currently Missing

**Your plan is excellent for the vendor evaluation MVP, but needs these additions to support the broader vision:**

#### 1. Event-Driven Architecture Details
- **Current:** Mentioned in blockers (#B4) but not in MVP requirements
- **Needed:** Event bus, event handlers, event routing, event subscriptions
- **Why:** Trading platform requires real-time event handling (market events, trade signals, etc.)
- **Impact:** Same event patterns needed for acquisition program milestone tracking

#### 2. Workflow Execution Engine (Beyond Process Engine)
- **Current:** Process Engine (#B5) mentioned for Camunda replacement
- **Needed:** Generic workflow execution for ANY domain (BPMN-driven actions)
- **Why:** Trading platform needs workflows to execute strategies, test strategies, react to events
- **Impact:** Acquisition programs need workflows for vendor selection, contract negotiation, etc.

#### 3. Action/Execution Capabilities
- **Current:** Plan focuses on analysis and comparison
- **Needed:** Ability to execute actions based on analysis (execute trades, generate contracts, etc.)
- **Why:** Trading platform must execute trades, not just analyze
- **Impact:** Acquisition programs need to generate RFPs, execute contracts, track deliverables

#### 4. External System Integration Layer
- **Current:** Not detailed in plan
- **Needed:** Generic integration patterns for APIs, databases, services
- **Why:** Trading platform needs market data APIs, broker APIs, etc.
- **Impact:** Acquisition programs need vendor systems, government databases, etc.

#### 5. Testing/Simulation Infrastructure
- **Current:** Not mentioned
- **Needed:** Backtesting for strategies, simulation for workflows
- **Why:** Trading platform needs strategy testing before live execution
- **Impact:** Acquisition programs need "what-if" scenario analysis

#### 6. Generic Ontology Patterns (Not Just bseo_v1)
- **Current:** Plan assumes bseo_v1 ontology
- **Needed:** Patterns and templates for creating ANY domain ontology
- **Why:** Trading ontologies differ from acquisition ontologies
- **Impact:** Need reusable patterns for classes, relationships, constraints

#### 7. Multi-Domain Abstraction Layer
- **Current:** Plan is vendor-evaluation specific
- **Needed:** Abstraction layer that makes any workflow work with any domain
- **Why:** Same workflow patterns apply to acquisition AND trading
- **Impact:** Generic "analyze → decide → execute" pattern

#### 8. Workflow Templates Library
- **Current:** Not mentioned
- **Needed:** Reusable workflow templates for common patterns
- **Why:** Both acquisition and trading use similar decision-making workflows
- **Impact:** Templates for evaluation, testing, execution, monitoring

## Future Vision: DAS Bootstrapping and Self-Organizing Systems

### The Aspirational Goal

**DAS-Powered Bootstrap:** With comprehensive knowledge priming, DAS could autonomously bootstrap entire systems:

**Example Scenario - Weapons Integration Program:**
```
1. Prime DAS with weapons integration knowledge base
2. DAS analyzes requirements and creates:
   - System ontology for weapons integration
   - Multiple projects (design, testing, simulation, analysis)
   - Knowledge assets for each capability
   - Concept mappings between projects
3. As new capabilities are added, DAS:
   - Creates modeling projects automatically
   - Generates simulation frameworks
   - Establishes analysis projects
   - Connects projects together via shared ontologies/concepts
4. DAS orchestrates the entire "system of systems"
   - Real-time data flow between projects
   - Event-driven coordination
   - Autonomous workflow execution
```

### What This Requires (Post-MVP)

**Foundation Elements Needed:**
- **Deep Knowledge Priming:** Rich knowledge base for DAS to understand domain
- **Ontology Generation:** DAS creates ontologies based on domain requirements
- **Project Creation:** DAS autonomously creates and configures projects
- **Concept Discovery:** DAS identifies and links concepts across projects
- **System Orchestration:** DAS coordinates multi-project workflows
- **Self-Organizing Architecture:** System that can grow and adapt autonomously

**Architecture Considerations for MVP:**
- Design extensible plugin system (enables future DAS automation)
- Make ontology creation programmatic (DAS can generate)
- Make project creation API-driven (DAS can call)
- Enable concept linking mechanisms (DAS can discover relationships)
- Design event-driven architecture (enables autonomous coordination)

### MVP Relevance

**Build MVP components with bootstrapping in mind:**
- ✅ Ontology APIs should support programmatic creation
- ✅ Project creation should be API-driven
- ✅ Data mapping should be discoverable/learnable
- ✅ Concepts should be linkable across projects
- ✅ Events should be publishable/subscribable

**If MVP components support these patterns, DAS bootstrapping becomes feasible post-MVP.**

### Advanced Vision: Multi-Agent DAS with Pub/Sub

**The Next Evolution:** Multiple DAS agents with specialized personas, coordinating via published/subscribed objects:

**Architecture Concept:**
```
Persona-Based Agents:
- Requirements Agent: Creates/manages requirements ontologies and extraction
- Architecture Agent: Creates/manages system architectures and components
- Integration Agent: Creates/manages integration points and interfaces
- Testing Agent: Creates/manages test frameworks and simulation projects
- Analysis Agent: Creates/manages analysis projects and evaluation criteria

Coordination via Pub/Sub:
- Agents publish "work products" (ontologies, projects, concepts)
- Agents subscribe to relevant work products
- Agents react to published objects to coordinate their work
- Project network emerges from agent interactions
```

**Example: Weapons Integration Bootstrap**
```
1. Requirements Agent publishes: "Requirements Ontology created for weapons system"
2. Architecture Agent subscribes, publishes: "System architecture project created"
3. Integration Agent subscribes to both, publishes: "Integration interfaces defined"
4. Testing Agent subscribes to architecture, publishes: "Test framework project created"
5. Analysis Agent subscribes to all, publishes: "Analysis project connects to integration points"
6. Result: Fully coordinated project network, bootstrapped autonomously
```

**Key Architectural Requirements:**
- **Pub/Sub Infrastructure:** Robust event/publish system (foundation block B9)
- **Agent Registry:** Management of persona-based agents
- **Work Product Semantics:** Structured objects with metadata
- **Subscription Patterns:** Agents declare interest patterns
- **Coordination Logic:** Agents know when/how to react to others' work
- **Conflict Resolution:** Handle cases where agents create conflicting structures

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Specialized expertise per agent (Requirements agent is requirement-focused)
- ✅ Parallel creation (multiple agents work simultaneously)
- ✅ Natural coordination (agents respond to each other's work)
- ✅ Emergent structure (project network emerges organically)
- ✅ Scalable (add new agent types as capabilities expand)

**Challenges:**
- ⚠️ Persona definition (what makes a good Requirements Agent persona?)
- ⚠️ Coordination complexity (avoid circular dependencies, deadlocks)
- ⚠️ Consistency (ensure agents maintain semantic consistency)
- ⚠️ Testing/debugging (harder to trace multi-agent interactions)
- ⚠️ Over-engineering risk (single DAS might be sufficient initially)

**Recommendation:**
- **Start MVP:** Single DAS with rich persona capability
- **Build Foundation:** Pub/sub infrastructure, API-first architecture
- **Validate Single Agent:** Does one well-primed DAS bootstrap effectively?
- **Evaluate Need:** Do multiple agents provide sufficient benefit to justify complexity?
- **Incremental Evolution:** If multi-agent needed, add one specialized agent at a time

**Bottom Line:** Multi-agent pub/sub bootstrapping is architecturally sound but adds significant complexity. Validate single-agent bootstrapping first, then evaluate if multi-agent adds enough value to justify the coordination overhead.

### Practical Application: Bootstrap-as-Starting-Point

**The Real-World Use Case:** DAS bootstraps a large project network that users inherit, rather than starting from scratch.

**Core Concept:**
```
1. DAS Creates Network (One Time):
   - Weapons Integration Network (ontologies, projects, workflows)
   - Aircraft Acquisition Network (vendor evaluation, contracting, testing)
   - Trading Platform Network (strategy design, backtesting, execution)
   
2. Users Start FROM Network (Every Time):
   - New weapons program? Start from pre-built network
   - New aircraft procurement? Start from pre-built network
   - New trading strategy? Start from pre-built network
   
3. Users Customize (Within Network):
   - Add project-specific requirements
   - Modify for unique constraints
   - Extend with new capabilities
   - Focus on their domain problem, not architecture
```

**Why This Is Brilliant:**

✅ **Solves "Blank Page" Problem**
- Most people struggle starting from zero
- Bootstrap provides structure to build on
- Jump-starts projects immediately

✅ **Captures Institutional Knowledge**
- Best practices baked into templates
- Domain expertise preserved
- Consistency across similar programs

✅ **Establishes Patterns Early**
- Correct ontology structure from day one
- Proper project relationships
- Right workflows and integrations

✅ **Scalable Approach**
- One bootstrap = infinite copies
- Different programs share same foundation
- Easy to replicate success

✅ **Focuses Users on Value**
- Users work on their problem, not infrastructure
- Domain experts don't need to be architects
- Faster time-to-value

**Key Considerations:**

⚠️ **Template Management**
- Who maintains the bootstrap templates?
- How do you update a template?
- Version control for templates
- Template drift over time

⚠️ **Flexibility vs Structure**
- Users need to customize bootstrap
- What if template doesn't fit?
- How much can they deviate?
- When does customization break structure?

⚠️ **Template Evolution**
- Do updates propagate to existing projects?
- Breaking changes in templates
- Migration path for old projects
- Balancing stability vs innovation

**Recommended Approach:**

**Phase 1: Create Bootstrap Library**
- DAS creates domain-specific bootstrap templates
- Library: Weapons, Acquisition, Trading, etc.
- Users select template at project creation
- Templates are versioned and documented

**Phase 2: Template Customization**
- Users clone template to new project
- Customize for specific needs
- Track deviations from template
- Option to "rebase" on template updates

**Phase 3: Continuous Improvement**
- Collect feedback on templates
- Evolve templates based on usage
- DAS learns from successful customizations
- Templates improve over time

**This Changes ODRAS Value Proposition:**

**Without Bootstrap:** 
"ODRAS helps you build your system" (users start from scratch)

**With Bootstrap:**
"ODRAS provides pre-built systems ready to use" (users inherit proven structure)

**Bottom Line:** Bootstrap-as-starting-point is the killer feature that makes ODRAS practical for real organizations. It transforms ODRAS from "powerful but requires expertise" to "powerful AND immediately usable." This is where DAS bootstrapping shifts from experimental to essential.

## Cross-Domain Workflow Comparison

### Same Workflow Pattern, Different Domains

**Vendor Evaluation Pattern:**
```
1. Define Requirements (bseo_v1 ontology)
2. Import Vendor Data
3. Analyze/Match (conceptualization, DAS)
4. Compare (tabularizer)
5. Decide (officer notes, DAS insights)
6. Execute (generate reports, select vendor)
7. Monitor (track vendor performance)
```

**Trading Platform Pattern:**
```
1. Define Strategy (trading ontology)
2. Import Market Data
3. Analyze/Test (backtesting)
4. Compare (strategy comparison)
5. Decide (DAS evaluation, risk analysis)
6. Execute (trade execution)
7. Monitor (position tracking, P&L)
```

**Common ODRAS Components Needed:**
- Ontology definition for domain
- Data import/mapping
- Analysis engine (conceptualization, backtesting)
- Comparison/tabularizer
- Decision support (DAS, notes)
- Execution framework
- Monitoring/reporting

## Three-Tier Vision Summary

**Tier 1: MVP (Vendor Evaluation)**
- Focus: Evaluate Bell vs Lockheed for aircraft program
- Scope: Requirements → Analysis → Comparison → Decision
- Timeline: Near-term deliverable

**Tier 2: Generic Platform**
- Focus: Same ODRAS works for acquisition programs AND trading platforms
- Scope: Domain-agnostic workflows, ontology patterns, event-driven architecture
- Requirements: Foundation blocks B9-B14

**Tier 3: DAS Bootstrapping**
- Focus: DAS autonomously creates and manages entire systems
- Scope: Self-organizing projects, ontologies, workflows, "system of systems"
- Requirements: API-first architecture, programmatic everything, event-driven coordination

**Tier 3+: Multi-Agent Coordination (Future)**
- Focus: Multiple specialized DAS agents coordinating via pub/sub
- Scope: Persona-based agents create coordinated project networks autonomously
- Requirements: Agent registry, work product semantics, subscription patterns, conflict resolution
- **Risk:** Significant complexity overhead; validate single-agent first

**Key Insight:** Each tier builds on the previous. MVP components designed with API-first principles enable Tier 2. Tier 2 architecture enables Tier 3 automation. Tier 3 pub/sub infrastructure enables Tier 3+ multi-agent coordination.

## Next Steps

1. Review created issues for completeness
2. Prioritize issue order based on dependencies
3. **Build MVP with API-first architecture** (enables all tiers)
4. Begin Phase 1 implementation
5. Test workflow end-to-end at each phase
6. Validate architecture supports future tiers

## Executive Summary and Review

### What You Have Right ✅

**Your vendor evaluation MVP plan is solid:**
- ✅ Correct ontology-first approach (guides conceptualization)
- ✅ Well-defined workflow (import → extract → map → conceptualize → evaluate)
- ✅ Focus on generic, flexible tabularizer
- ✅ Strong emphasis on data mapping flexibility
- ✅ Clear success criteria for vendor evaluation use case

### What You're Missing ❌

**For the generic platform vision, you need to add:**

1. **Event-Driven Architecture** - Critical for trading platform and program milestones
2. **Workflow Execution Engine** - Beyond analysis, need to execute actions
3. **Action Execution Framework** - Execute trades, generate contracts, etc.
4. **External Integration Layer** - Connect to market data, vendor APIs, etc.
5. **Testing/Simulation** - Backtesting for strategies, what-if scenarios
6. **Generic Ontology Patterns** - Reusable patterns for ANY domain
7. **Multi-Domain Abstraction** - Make workflows work across domains
8. **Workflow Templates** - Common patterns for evaluation/testing/execution

### My Recommendation 🎯

**Focus on the vendor evaluation MVP first, but:**
- Build the foundation blocks (B9-B14) with generic patterns in mind
- Every feature should be designed to work with ANY ontology/domain
- When you build "requirements import," think "generic data import"
- When you build "tabularizer," think "generic analysis tool"
- When you build "reporting," think "generic output generation"

**The Critical Insight:**
Both your acquisition program and trading platform follow the same pattern:
```
Define Domain → Import Data → Analyze → Compare → Decide → Execute → Monitor
```

ODRAS should implement this pattern ONCE, make it generic, and let the ontology + plugins make it domain-specific.

### Bottom Line

Your plan is **85% there** for the vendor evaluation MVP. To reach the generic platform vision, add the foundation blocks (B9-B14) and maintain a strict abstraction discipline. Every feature you build should be asking: "How would this work for a trading platform?" If you can't answer that, you're building vendor-evaluation-specific code instead of generic platform code.

### The Ultimate Vision: DAS Bootstrapping

**Important Note:** The plan now includes aspirational notes about DAS bootstrapping - where DAS could autonomously create entire systems (projects, ontologies, knowledge assets, concepts) in a self-organizing manner. This informs MVP architecture:

- **Build APIs, not just UIs** (DAS can call APIs)
- **Make everything programmatic** (DAS can generate ontologies, create projects)
- **Enable concept linking** (DAS can discover relationships)
- **Design event-driven** (DAS can orchestrate workflows)
- **Think "system of systems"** (DAS can coordinate multiple projects)

**Key Principle:** If MVP components are API-driven, extensible, and event-driven, then DAS bootstrapping becomes feasible post-MVP. Don't build shortcuts or UI-only features - build the architecture that enables future automation.
